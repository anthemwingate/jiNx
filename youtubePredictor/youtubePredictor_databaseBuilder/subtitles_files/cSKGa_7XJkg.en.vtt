00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:10.560
There's a quote usually attributed
to the writer Mark Twain that goes,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.211
"A lie can travel 
halfway around the world

00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:17.269
while the truth is putting on its shoes."

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.936
Funny thing about that.

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:22.985
There's reason to doubt
that Mark Twain ever said this at all,

00:00:22.985 --> 00:00:26.000
thus, ironically, proving the point.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.753
And today, the quote, whoever said it,
is truer than ever before.

00:00:31.753 --> 00:00:35.180
In previous decades, 
most media with global reach

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.496
consisted of several 
major newspapers and networks

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:43.062
which had the resources
to gather information directly.

00:00:43.062 --> 00:00:45.722
Outlets like Reuters
and the Associated Press

00:00:45.722 --> 00:00:51.921
that aggregate or rereport stories
were relatively rare compared to today.

00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:54.846
The speed with which 
information spreads now

00:00:54.846 --> 00:01:00.623
has created the ideal conditions for
a phenomenon known as circular reporting.

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:04.225
This is when publication A
publishes misinformation,

00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:06.916
publication B reprints it,

00:01:06.916 --> 00:01:12.807
and publication A then cites B
as the source for the information.

00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:15.433
It's also considered a form
of circular reporting

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:17.871
when multiple publications

00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:21.122
report on the same initial piece 
of false information,

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:27.414
which then appears to another author as
having been verified by multiple sources.

00:01:27.414 --> 00:01:32.678
For instance, the 1998 publication
of a single pseudoscientific paper

00:01:32.678 --> 00:01:36.667
arguing that routine vaccination
of children causes autism

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:40.584
inspired an entire 
antivaccination movement,

00:01:40.584 --> 00:01:44.697
despite the fact that the original paper
has repeatedly been discredited

00:01:44.697 --> 00:01:47.173
by the scientific community.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:52.157
Deliberately unvaccinated children
are now contracting contagious diseases

00:01:52.157 --> 00:01:56.007
that had been virtually 
eradicated in the United States,

00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:58.803
with some infections proving fatal.

00:01:58.803 --> 00:02:00.890
In a slightly less dire example,

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.676
satirical articles that are formatted
to resemble real ones

00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:09.236
can also be picked up by outlets
not in on the joke.

00:02:09.236 --> 00:02:14.362
For example, a joke article in the
reputable British Medical Journal entitled

00:02:14.362 --> 00:02:19.513
"Energy Expenditure in Adolescents
Playing New Generation Computer Games,"

00:02:19.513 --> 00:02:25.548
has been referenced in serious
science publications over 400 times.

00:02:25.548 --> 00:02:27.999
User-generated content, such as wikis,

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.853
are also a common contributer
to circular reporting.

00:02:31.853 --> 00:02:35.869
As more writers come to rely
on such pages for quick information,

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:41.137
an unverified fact in a wiki page
can make its way into a published article

00:02:41.137 --> 00:02:46.213
that may later be added as a citation
for the very same wiki information,

00:02:46.213 --> 00:02:49.038
making it much harder to debunk.

00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:51.517
Recent advances 
in communication technology

00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:53.436
have had immeasurable benefits

00:02:53.436 --> 00:02:57.518
in breaking down the barriers
between information and people.

00:02:57.518 --> 00:02:59.315
But our desire for quick answers

00:02:59.315 --> 00:03:03.335
may overpower the desire 
to be certain of their validity.

00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:07.574
And when this bias can be multiplied by
billions of people around the world,

00:03:07.574 --> 00:03:11.877
nearly instantaneously,
more caution is in order.

00:03:11.877 --> 00:03:13.832
Avoiding sensationalist media,

00:03:13.832 --> 00:03:16.980
searching for criticisms 
of suspicious information,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.088
and tracing the original source
of a report can help slow down a lie,

00:03:22.088 --> 00:03:25.360
giving the truth more time 
to put on its shoes.
