00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:09.884
If someone asked you
who the richest people in history were,

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:11.452
who would you name?

00:00:11.452 --> 00:00:13.828
Perhaps a billionaire banker
or corporate mogul,

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:16.727
like Bill Gates or John D. Rockefeller.

00:00:16.727 --> 00:00:20.640
How about African King Musa Keita I?

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.105
Ruling the Mali Empire 
in the 14th century CE,

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.719
Mansa Musa, or the King of Kings,

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:29.409
amassed a fortune that possibly made him

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:33.099
one of the wealthiest 
people who ever lived.

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:37.442
But his vast wealth was only
one piece of his rich legacy.

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:40.674
When Mansa Musa came to power in 1312,

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:44.436
much of Europe was racked 
by famine and civil wars.

00:00:44.436 --> 00:00:48.519
But many African kingdoms
and the Islamic world were flourishing,

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.527
and Mansa Musa played a great role
in bringing the fruits of this flourishing

00:00:52.527 --> 00:00:54.684
to his own realm.

00:00:54.684 --> 00:00:57.541
By strategically annexing 
the city of Timbuktu,

00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:00.815
and reestablishing power 
over the city of Gao,

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:03.545
he gained control 
over important trade routes

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:07.074
between the Mediterranean 
and the West African Coast,

00:01:07.074 --> 00:01:12.213
continuing a period of expansion,
which dramatically increased Mali's size.

00:01:12.213 --> 00:01:16.227
The territory of the Mali Empire
was rich in natural resources,

00:01:16.227 --> 00:01:18.356
such as gold and salt.

00:01:18.356 --> 00:01:22.855
The world first witnessed the extent
of Mansa Musa's wealth in 1324

00:01:22.855 --> 00:01:25.516
when he took his pilgrimage to Mecca.

00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:27.376
Not one to travel on a budget,

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:31.170
he brought a caravan stretching
as far as the eye could see.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.952
Accounts of this journey are mostly
based on an oral testimony

00:01:34.952 --> 00:01:36.647
and differing written records,

00:01:36.647 --> 00:01:40.223
so it's difficult to determine
the exact details.

00:01:40.223 --> 00:01:44.750
But what most agree on is the extravagant
scale of the excursion.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.664
Chroniclers describe an entourage 
of tens of thousands of soldiers,

00:01:48.664 --> 00:01:49.884
civilians,

00:01:49.884 --> 00:01:51.074
and slaves,

00:01:51.074 --> 00:01:55.114
500 heralds bearing gold staffs
and dressed in fine silks,

00:01:55.114 --> 00:02:00.039
and many camels and horses
bearing an abundance of gold bars.

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.058
Stopping in cities such as Cairo,

00:02:02.058 --> 00:02:05.524
Mansa Musa is said to have spent
massive quantities of gold,

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:08.187
giving to the poor, buying souvenirs,

00:02:08.187 --> 00:02:11.400
and even having mosques 
built along the way.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.455
In fact, his spending may have 
destabilized the regional economy,

00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:18.147
causing mass inflation.

00:02:18.147 --> 00:02:22.660
This journey reportedly took over a year,
and by the time Mansa Musa returned,

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.584
tales of his amazing wealth had spread
to the ports of the Mediterranean.

00:02:27.584 --> 00:02:31.285
Mali and its king were elevated
to near legendary status,

00:02:31.285 --> 00:02:36.307
cemented by their inclusion 
on the 1375 Catalan Atlas.

00:02:36.307 --> 00:02:39.857
One of the most important world maps
of Medieval Europe,

00:02:39.857 --> 00:02:44.589
it depicted the King holding a scepter
and a gleaming gold nugget.

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:49.848
Mansa Musa had literally put his empire
and himself on the map.

00:02:49.848 --> 00:02:52.963
But material riches weren't 
the king's only concern.

00:02:52.963 --> 00:02:56.782
As a devout Muslim, 
he took a particular interest in Timbuktu,

00:02:56.782 --> 00:03:01.861
already a center of religion 
and learning prior to its annexation.

00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:03.853
Upon returning from his pilgrimage,

00:03:03.853 --> 00:03:06.513
he had the great 
Djinguereber Mosque built there

00:03:06.513 --> 00:03:09.820
with the help of 
an Andalusian architect.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.461
He also established a major university,
further elevating the city's reputation,

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:18.941
and attracting scholars and students
from all over the Islamic world.

00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:22.116
Under Mansa Musa,
the Empire became urbanized,

00:03:22.116 --> 00:03:26.517
with schools and mosques
in hundreds of densely populated towns.

00:03:26.517 --> 00:03:29.315
The king's rich legacy 
persisted for generations

00:03:29.315 --> 00:03:33.015
and to this day, there are mausoleums,
libraries and mosques

00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:38.051
that stand as a testament 
to this golden age of Mali's history.
