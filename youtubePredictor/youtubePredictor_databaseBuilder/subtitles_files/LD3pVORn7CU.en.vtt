00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.310
Everyone's got haters, even girl-next-door
Jennifer Lawrence.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.420
Some fans believe the actress's attempts to
be super-relatable are a mere marketing ploy,

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.360
while others find her behavior off-putting.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.500
In addition, the Hunger Games star has managed
to rack up some A-list enemies.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.360
Here are the celebs who simply can't stand
J-Law.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.100
Lindsay Lohan

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.760
During an appearance on The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert in December 2015, Lawrence

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.840
stirred up some controversy with an unexpected
dig at former child star Lindsay Lohan.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.920
While chatting about a brutal stomach virus
she had on the set of Joy, Lawrence said,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:40.080
"I get, like, Lindsay Lohan-grade exhaustion,
but without any drugs or alcohol, I'm always

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.720
in bed early."

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.580
According to HuffPost, Lohan's younger sister,
Ali, immediately jumped to her defense, writing

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.040
in a since-deleted tweet:

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.680
"I never breathe life into negativity but
I stand by my family.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.900
Disappointed in Jennifer Lawrence…

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.000
Not cool."

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.180
Lohan then joined the conversation herself,
answering her sister in a tweet that also

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.180
been removed:

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.620
"Thank you sister…

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.340
Maybe who you're referring to should learn
to support others like #mayaangelou."

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.340
She accompanied her snarky remark with an
image of a quote from late poet Maya Angelou's

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.100
piece "Still I Rise."

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.980
Jared Leto

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.420
Lawrence presented the award for Best Actor
at the 2014 Oscars, and as she took the stage,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.700
Jared Leto was apparently cracking up in his
seat.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.980
"Why are you laughing?

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.700
What?

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.520
Is this funny?

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.120
Oh, OK."

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.680
Leto told Access Hollywood that it had been
Ellen DeGeneres making him laugh, but when

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.800
he was then asked about Lawrence's red carpet
fall that evening — her second Academy Awards

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.680
mishap following the tumble she took while
accepting the Best Actress award a year prior

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.980
— he didn't mince words.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.700
"You know, I'm starting to wonder if this
is a bit of an act."

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.540
Joan Rivers

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.900
At one point in a November 2013 conversation
with Yahoo, the topic turned to body positivity

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.800
and Lawrence's experience with body image
criticism in Hollywood.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.380
In response to a question from the audience,
the actress shared her distaste for Joan Rivers'

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.420
hit show, Fashion Police.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.340
"They put values in all the things that are
wrong.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.620
And that it's okay to point at people and
call them 'ugly' or call them 'fat.'

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.220
They call it 'fun' and 'Welcome to the real
world!'"

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.760
Rivers was none too impressed with Lawrence's
comments and took to Twitter to let the world

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.640
know, clapping back, "It's funny how Jennifer
Lawrence loved [Fashion Police] during Awards

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.140
Season when we were complimenting her every
single week."

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.940
She returned just a few minutes later to add,
"WAIT!

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.240
It just dawned on me why Jennifer Lawrence
fell on her way up to the stage to get her

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.740
Oscar.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.180
She tripped over her own arrogance."

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.599
In December 2013, less than a year before
her passing, Rivers appeared to still have

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.220
Lawrence's criticism on her mind, as she told
Page Six,

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.700
"My New Year's resolution is [ensuring] Jennifer
Lawrence grows up and realizes how lucky she

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.740
is and calms down."

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.620
Chloë Sevigny

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.200
In an interview with V Magazine in 2015, actress
Chloe Sevigny was asked if she ever worries

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.080
about being typecast.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.700
After admitting that she does, the actress
explained,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.200
"So much is about marketing and selling the
product.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.540
They'll have a really peppy funny girl on
the talk show rounds, and everybody adores

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.840
her and loves her and wants to be her or f---
her, and then so many more people want to

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.960
watch the movie or TV show."

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.680
Sevigny went on to name a couple of A-listers
she admires — women like Angelina Jolie

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.160
and Emma Stone — and at least one she could
do without.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.200
She revealed,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.720
"Jennifer Lawrence I find annoying.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.700
Too crass."

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.660
Miley Cyrus

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.140
After calling off their engagement in 2013,
Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth rekindled their

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.920
romance three years later and, according to
a source who spoke to In Touch, it's all thanks

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.180
to Jennifer Lawrence.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.100
Or, rather, Cyrus' alleged jealousy.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.320
The source claimed,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.500
"When Miley realized there might be something
serious between Jennifer and Liam, she decided

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.840
to do something to get him back.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.080
[She] wanted to do everything in her power
to make him realize she was right for him,

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.620
not Jennifer."

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.939
The jealousy was likely sparked by headlines
claiming that the Hunger Games co-stars were

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:58.230
dating — and Lawrence herself didn't do
much to dispel the speculation when she appeared

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.920
on Watch What Happens Live in December 2015.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.120
When host Andy Cohen asked if she had ever
kissed Hemsworth off-camera, Lawrence said,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.120
"Liam and I grew up together.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.640
Liam's real hot."

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.440
"What would you have done?"

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.040
"Yes.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.940
I would say 'yes!'"

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.820
"Yeah!"

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.520
"Very good, very good."

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.940
Spencer Pratt

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.120
In 2017, Lawrence told Vogue that when she
moved into her new house, there were crystals

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.740
all over the place, and she wanted them removed
so that people didn't think she was a, quote,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.500
"crystal person."

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.140
People in her life warned her to wait, claiming
it should be the person who put the crystals

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.380
in who takes them out, but instead of listening
to the advice, the actress…

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.540
"...just had all the crystals yanked out.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.520
Sold them.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.020
And then my f---ing house flooded.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.020
I hate crystals."

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.460
Soon after the story ran, former The Hills
star Spencer Pratt announced that, as a crystal-lover,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.760
he felt personally attacked by Lawrence's
remarks.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.100
He took to Twitter to post an image of her
quote, which he captioned: "Legit never seeing

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.600
another J-LAW movie she is OVER."

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.940
