00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.310
It's me again. First today I'd like to say thank you once again for having me not once but

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.240
twice is an extreme honor to not only
the United Nations but also to UNICEF.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.019
For having me be a partner with them is
a dream come true in such a meaningful

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.920
part of my life so thank you so much. Now after hearing everyone speak I don't

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.960
know about you but I am feeling pretty
ready. I'm United with each and every one

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.220
of you to help create a world where
every young person is empowered.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.420
Where every young person is educated and where every young person is skilled and

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.950
prepared to fulfill their full potential.
And like I said earlier young people

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.800
make up 25% of the world's population.
That's like a lot of people. That's

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.260
literally billions of people and all of
them watched my YouTube videos...no I'm kidding

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.629
no I'm kidding give or take a few don't
quote me, but the point I'm making is they

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.000
are the most connected generation
there's ever been. We have access to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.870
borderless tools and technologies that allow us to share our voices our

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.060
knowledge and our experiences further
than ever before and that's exactly how

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.070
I found my platform using a technology
that didn't exist 13 years ago called

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.369
YouTube and that's why my parents don't
know what I do for a living.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.659
But when technology is moving and
changing so fast the world has to keep

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.220
up so that all young people have access
no matter where they live or what their

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.700
circumstances are. Now getting to where I am today

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.189
and achieving this level of success was
not easy but when I compared myself to

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.329
the circumstances of what the majority of young people face so I'll be honest I

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.890
feel like I practically won the lottery
I mean I got to receive an education

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.619
I got support I didn't have to face
obstacles such as poverty conflict or

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.479
failed institutions. For most young
people in the world the opportunities

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.090
they need are so far from reach because
of problems like these but here's the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.969
good news - there's good news -  it's not all sad, there's good news. When you empower

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.209
you like that you like that that's good
thank you thank you UNICEF I can always

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.140
count on you good, you're correct for
laughing. When you empower a young

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.430
you're not just giving them a chance to
change their own life, you're also giving

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.050
them a chance to change the lives of so
many other people because I've had the

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.310
privilege of travelling to a lot of
places such as South Africa, Kenya, India

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.320
to name a few and every time I speak to
the youth there I ask, what would you

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.570
like to be when you grow up and every
single time the answer is always along

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.990
the lines of a doctor, a pharmacist, a
nurse, or a counselor the answer is

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.090
always something that child knows their
community so desperately needs so when

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.410
we give skills and education to young
people they become the leaders and

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.170
beacons of light this world needs so if
we want to solve any problem from

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.360
conflict to disease, to climate change, we
have to start with young people and

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.910
acknowledge the huge impact they have in their communities, in their countries and

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.959
in the world. Now as you may know I love
a good video so I couldn't resist

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.190
showing you one today. This is the story
of just one young woman who did

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.150
everything she could to realize her full
potential and how everything can change

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.320
when just one person gives you a chance.
Let's see what she has to say
