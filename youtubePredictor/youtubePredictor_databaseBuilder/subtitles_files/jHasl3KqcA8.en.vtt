GOVERNMENT, I’M ALWAYS STRUCK BY

00:00:27.085 --> 00:00:30.360 line:92%
HOW ONLY IN AMERICA WOULD WE BE

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.744 line:92%
WHERE WE ARE TODAY, WHERE LIFE

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:35.492 line:92%
CAN BE HARD AND CRUEL, BUT THERE

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:38.146 line:92%
IS HOPE IN THE STRUGGLE, THERE

00:00:38.147 --> 00:00:41.355 line:92%
IS PROMISE IN OUR DREAMS, WHERE

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:44.572 line:92%
YOU LEARN TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF

00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:47.514 line:92%
AND THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:51.355 line:92%
LIKE BOTH OF YOU, I LEARNED FROM

00:00:51.356 --> 00:00:52.654 line:92%
MY FAMILY, MR. PRESIDENT-ELECT,

WORDS THAT YOU SAID ABOUT ME.

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:58.944 line:92%
MY PARENTS HAD VERY LITTLE BACK

00:00:58.978 --> 00:01:01.145 line:92%
IN LOUISIANA WHERE I GREW UP,

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:02.941 line:92%
BUT THEY GAVE ME AND MY SIBLINGS

00:01:02.943 --> 00:01:04.114 line:92%
EVERYTHING THEY HAD, AND I KNOW

00:01:04.115 --> 00:01:07.136 line:92%

HE TOLD ME CONSTANTLY, LINDA,

00:01:28.017 --> 00:01:29.675 line:92%
DON’T UNDERSELL YOURSELF.

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.232 size:81% position:41% line:92%
AND HE WOULD ALWAYS DO

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:33.588 line:92%
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO LIFT ME

00:01:33.623 --> 00:01:34.168 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%

KNOW HE’S HERE WITH US TODAY.

00:01:39.784 --> 00:01:42.622 line:92%
AND ON THIS DAY I’M THINKING

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:44.348 line:92%

00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:01.995 line:92%
HEARD YOU SAY HOW ALL POLITICS

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:04.699 line:92%
IS PERSONAL, AND THAT’S HOW YOU

00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:07.173 line:92%
BUILD RELATIONSHIPS OF TRUST AND

00:02:07.174 --> 00:02:08.525 line:92%
BRIDGE DISAGREEMENTS AND FIND

00:02:08.526 --> 00:02:09.209 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
COMMON GROUND.

00:02:09.243 --> 00:02:13.118 line:92%

FOREIGN SERVICE ACROSS FOUR

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:17.960 line:92%
CONTINENTS, I PUT A CAJUN SPIN

00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:19.881 size:88% position:44% line:92%
ON IT, I CALLED IT GUMBO

00:02:19.882 --> 00:02:20.280 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
DIPLOMACY.

00:02:20.314 --> 00:02:22.145 line:92%
WHEREVER I WAS POSTED AROUND THE

00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:23.745 line:92%
WORLD, I WOULD INVITE PEOPLE OF

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.071 line:92%
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND

00:02:25.073 --> 00:02:28.010 line:92%
BELIEFS TO HELP ME MAKE A ROUX

TRINITY AND MAKE HOMEMADE GUMBO.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.120 line:92%
IT WAS MY WAY OF BREAKING DOWN

BARRIERS, CONNECTING WITH

00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:40.648 line:92%
PEOPLE, AND STARTING TO SEE EACH

UNRELENTING AND INTERCONNECTED.

00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:05.120 line:92%
BUT THEY’RE NOT UNRESOLVABLE IF
