00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.501
Boris Johnson:

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:05.004
British prime minister and ghost
whose just seen a ghost.

00:00:05.037 --> 00:00:07.006
He took time
from the chaos of Brexit

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:08.775
to come and warn
the United Nations

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.911
of an even bigger threat that
will effect the entire world:

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:14.747
the robot apocalypse.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.483
You may keep your secrets
from your friends,

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:21.154
from your parents,
your children, your doctor,

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.023
even your personal trainer.

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:25.992
But it takes real effort

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.528
to conceal your thoughts
from Google.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.064
Your mattress will monitor
your nightmares.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.965
Your fridge will beep
for more cheese.

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:36.736
A future Alexa will pretend
to take orders,

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.539
but this Alexa will be watching
you, clucking her tongue,

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.174
or will it bring terrifying

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.776
limbless chickens to our table?

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.812
(laughter)

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:53.853
I think the Brexit pressure
is getting to Boris.

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:56.222
Because what was
he even talking about?

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:57.790
(mimics Johnson):
"Your wireless humidifier

00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:59.292
"will know your blood type.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:02.228
"Our Roombas will make
passionate love to our wives,

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.363
"and robot barbers
will give my--

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:06.999
everyone your haircut."

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:08.601
(normal voice):
Like, I'm not gonna lie,

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:11.104
this was a weird speech
for Boris to give at the U.N.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:12.839
Although he was right at home

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:15.007
giving the same speech
on the subway at 4:00 a.m.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.309
He fit right in.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:17.510
Yeah, he was just like,
(mimics Johnson):

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:18.945
"The robots will steal our eyes.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.880
"And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm selling candy.

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:24.183
"Please note it's not
for my team, it's for Brexit.

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:26.219
I'm trying to pay for Brexit."

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.121
(normal voice): You know who
I bet was loving Boris' speech

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:30.189
when this was happening,
is all the countries

00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:32.058
that Britain has colonized
in the past.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.060
Yeah, 'cause it's the
United Nations, so I bet, like,

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:35.661
half of African countries
were sitting there like,

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:37.063
"Oh, now you say it's bad

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.764
"if someone takes over
and kills you, eh?

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:40.633
"Tell me more, tell me more.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.468
"Keep going, keep going, Boris.

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:44.403
"Keep going.

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:46.305
"Yeah, tell me more.

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:48.975
Uh-huh."

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.943
It's also funny how humans
always give speeches

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:52.612
about robots destroying us

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.881
as if humans aren't already
destroying us.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.349
Like, we're already
doing everything

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:58.084
that people say that robots
are gonna do, right?

00:01:58.117 --> 00:01:59.452
Think about it.
We're burning forests,

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:01.687
we're killing each other, we're
poisoning our own air and water,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.623
but then we're like,
"But when the robots come,

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:06.159
things are gonna get bad."

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.693
So anyway, Boris is paranoid.

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:10.630
Robots aren't taking over,
so let's move on.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:14.834
To this exciting new story
from the world of technology.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:16.903
TV REPORTER: Boston Dynamics
just released its latest robot.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.838
That bad boy
is doing gymnastics.

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.541
It's named Atlas, showing off
his gymnastic skills.

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:23.276
It stands nearly
five feet tall,

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.579
does a complete series of
somersaults, jumps, twists,

00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:30.483
and a handstand
before sticking the landing.

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:33.853
Oh, okay.
Uh, maybe Boris was right.

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:35.354
Uh...

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:37.490
That was, uh,
that was interesting.

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:39.225
(mimics Johnson): "Agile robots
will do front flips

00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:42.195
and steal our gold medals
at the Olympics."

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.996
(normal voice): Although,
it would be weird

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.666
if they let robots into
the Olympics, wouldn't it?

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.401
Like, because what are you
gonna award them with?

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:50.069
It can't be medals.

00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:51.504
You'll give them a bronze
and they'll be like,

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:54.541
(robotic voice): "This medal
used to be my father."
