00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.220
In the past five years, USB-C has become the
go-to connector for a wide range of devices.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.050
It’s used on most android phones, notebooks,
tablets, game consoles, headphones, and even

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.929
accessories like mice, keyboards, and external
storage drives.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.260
But when it comes to Apple’s most popular
product, the iPhone, USB-C has yet to be adopted.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.960
Instead, every model of iPhone still uses
a Lightning connector that was introduced

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.539
eight years ago with the iPhone 5.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.829
This has led people to wonder why Apple hasn’t
transitioned the iPhone to USB-C, especially

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.650
for a company who has a reputation of being
the first to adopt new standards.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.940
So in this video, I’m going to explain why
Apple hasn’t transitioned the iPhone to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.879
USB-C, and what that means for their users.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.210

and polls like this one will begin appearing

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.529
Alright now why would Apple, the company who
adopted USB-A before anyone else with the

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:10.279
original iMac, take so long to bring USB-C
to their smartphones?

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:14.990
It’s pretty bizarre, especially considering
they’ve already included it in their iPad

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.200
and Mac lineup.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.740
Well, the answer lies in a story that begins
in 2010, when Apple was developing the iPhone

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.740
5.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.890
The device would be twelve percent smaller
by volume compared to the previous 4S.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.799
Which meant the large 30-pin connector needed
to be replaced by something smaller in order

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.479
to free up space for other components.

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.299
At the time, Apple was helping to develop
the USB-C standard with other companies like

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.499
Intel, Microsoft, and Samsung.

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:46.340
But the new connector wouldn’t be ready
until 2014.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.899
Two years after the iPhone 5’s release.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.810
So because of the bad timing, Apple was forced
into a corner.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.439
They could either keep the 30-pin connector
for another two generations and sacrifice

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.299
the iPhone 5 and 5s’ compact designs.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.639
Or they could create their own proprietary
connector and cause fragmentation within not

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:10.619
only the smartphone industry, but their own
product ecosystem.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.930
It was a lose-lose proposition, but Apple
went with the latter option.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.590
That decision not only cause a huge amount
of backlash from users in 2012, who were frustrated

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.220
that Apple made all of their previous iPhone
accessories obsolete, but it’s still causing

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.310
them issues to this very day.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.959
For example, when USB-C was ready to go in
2014, Apple wasn’t in a position to transition

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.400
the iPhone lineup a second time, just two
years later.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.620
They knew they had to stick with lightning
for as long as possible, or else they would

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.689
be in for a PR nightmare.

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:49.150
So they persisted, and when the AirPods were
introduced in 2016, Apple was forced to use

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.980
the same connector as the iPhone, since the
two products were designed to be used together

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.099
seamlessly.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.310
So Lightning was introduced to yet another
product line.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.870
One that would expand into the AirPods Pro
and AirPods Max, which also had to use Lightning

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.390
to maintain consistency between models.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.720
It’s almost like there was a smaller iPhone
ecosystem that existed within the larger Apple

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.989
ecosystem.

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.409
Because while the iPhone and its accessories
continued to use Lightning, almost every other

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:25.060
Apple product adopted USB-C. The MacBook line
began the transition in 2015, the iPad line

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.430
in 2018, and the Mac Pro in 2019.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.000
You also have to consider the other controversial
changes Apple made with the iPhone in previous

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
years.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.450
They removed the headphone jack in 2016, and
they removed the wall adapter from the iPhone’s

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.140
packaging in 2020.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.689
Both of these decisions caused perhaps even
more backlash than the transition to Lightning

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:51.409
in 2012, and caused Apple to think twice before
moving to USB-C, which would only add fuel

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:52.840
to the fire.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.040
So how can we expect Apple to resolve this
connector fragmentation issue in the future?

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.319
Well, rumors are suggesting that it won’t
be resolved, since Apple isn’t planning

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.560
on transitioning the iPhone to USB-C at all.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.800
Instead, they’re exploring the possibility
of removing the connector from certain iPhone

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.920
models entirely.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.510
And there are benefits to this approach.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.509
A smartphone with no port would be more water
resistant since its chassis could be completely

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:18.509
sealed off.

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.370
And it would be more durable.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.970
Since inserting and removing a connector thousands
of times can cause wear, buildup of debris,

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.650
and contact issues.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.300
But how would the phone be charged without
a port?

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.410
Well, Apple has already implemented a solution
with the iPhone 12 lineup.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.060
The models have something called Magsafe,
which is essentially a Qi wireless charger

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.360
surrounded by a ring of magnets.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.360
This makes the charging experience very similar
to an Apple Watch, a device that also happens

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.419
to be port-less.

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.610
And if Apple wants to include wireless data
pass through, they can simply borrow the Smart

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.580
Connector from the iPad.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.520
Everything Apple needs to create a port-less
iPhone already exists, and it only seems to

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.310
be a matter of time before they make the transition
away from wired connectors entirely.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.580
At that point, I think each category of Apple
device will of their own unique methods of

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.580
charging.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.120
Their computers and iPads, which Apple has
been calling computer replacements anyway,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.710
will feature USB-C. Their mobile devices like
the iPhone and Apple Watch will feature convenient

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.190
grab-and-go magnetic wireless charging.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.300
While accessories like the AirPods, Magic
Mouse, and Magic Keyboard, will continue to

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.440
use Lightning.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.610
With wireless charging available when possible
as a convenience feature.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.160
This approach makes the most sense to me,
but we’ll have to wait and see what decisions

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.599
Apple makes with the release of new products
in the near future.

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.539
Alright guys thanks for watching until the
end, don’t forget to subscribe to help decide

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.740
which topics I cover, and I’ll see you in
the next video.
