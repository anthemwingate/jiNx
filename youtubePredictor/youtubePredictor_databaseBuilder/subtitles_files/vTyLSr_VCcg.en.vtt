00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:06.929
Please welcome Newly appointed United Nations Messenger of Peace, Mr. Leonardo DiCaprio

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.170
Thank you, Mr. Secretary-General,

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:25.679
your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, and distinguished guests. I'm honored to be here today.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.659
I stand before you not as an expert, but as a concerned citizen.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:38.009
One of the 400,000 people who marched in the streets of New York on Sunday and the billions of others around the world

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.070
who want to solve our climate crisis.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.570
As an actor,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.070
I pretend for a living. I play fictitious characters, often

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.620
solving fictitious problems.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.299
I believe that mankind has looked at climate change in that same way.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.140
As if it were a fiction. As if pretending that climate change wasn't real would somehow make it go away.

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.169
But I think we all know better than that now.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.000
Every week, we're seeing new and undeniable climate events, evidence that accelerated climate change is here right now.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.480
Droughts are intensifying, our oceans are acidifying with methane plumes rising up from the ocean floor,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.800
we are seeing extreme weather events, and the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets melting at unprecedented rates,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.720
decades ahead of scientific projections.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.960
None of this is rhetoric, and none of it is hysteria. It is fact.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.200
The Scientific Community knows it,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.689
industry knows it, governments know it, even the United States military knows it.

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:50.489
The Chief of the US Navy's Pacific Command Admiral Samuel Locklear recently said that climate change is our single greatest

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.600
security threat.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.019
My friends, this body,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:03.920
perhaps more than any other gathering in human history; now faces this difficult, but achievable task.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.880
You can make history or you will be vilified by it.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.860
To be clear this is not about just telling people to change their lightbulbs, or to buy a hybrid car.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.980
This disaster has grown beyond the choices that individuals make.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.360
This is now about our industries and our governments around the world,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.480
taking decisive

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.490
large-scale action.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.670
Now must be our moment for action.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.200
We need to put a price tag on carbon emissions, and eliminate government subsidies for all oil, coal, and gas companies,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.140
we need to end the free ride that industrial polluters have been given in the name of a free-market economy.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:51.520
They do not deserve our tax dollars, they deserve our scrutiny; for the economy itself will die if our ecosystems collapse.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.660
The good news is that renewable energy is not only achievable, but good economic policy.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.760
This is not a partisan debate, it is a human one. Clean air and a livable climate are inalienable human rights, and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.440
solving this crisis is not a question of politics, it is a question of our own survival.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.020
This is the most urgent of times and the most urgent of messages.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.380
Honored delegates,

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.380
leaders of the World,

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.770
I pretend for a living,

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:34.940
but you do not. The people made their voices heard on Sunday around the world and the momentum will not stop.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.000
But now it is your turn. The time to answer humankind's greatest challenge is

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.020
now. We beg of you to face it with courage and honesty.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.460
Thank you.
