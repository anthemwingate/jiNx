00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:07.090
It is astounding how significantly
one idea can shape a society and its policies.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.670
Consider this one:

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.170
If taxes on the rich go up,
job creation will go down.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.380
This idea is an article of faith for Republicans
and seldom challenged by Democrats

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.080
and has indeed shaped much
of the economic landscape.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.439
But sometimes the ideas
that we are certain are true

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.939
are dead wrong.

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.390
Consider that for thousands of years,
humans believed that the Earth

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.430
was the center of the Universe.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.430
It's not.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.740
And an astronomer
who still believes that it was

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.900
would do some pretty terrible astronomy.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.170
Likewise, a policy maker who believes

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.149
that the rich are job creators
and therefore should not be taxed

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.450
will do equally terrible policy.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.949
I have started and helped start
dozens of companies

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.710
and initially hired lots of people,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.480
but if there was no-one around
who could afford to buy what we have to sell,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.250
all those companies and
all those jobs would have evaporated.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.920
That's why I can say with confidence
that rich people don't create jobs.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.000
Nor do businesses, large or small.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.030
Jobs are a consequence

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.000
of a circle of lifelike feedback loop
between customers and businesses.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.470
And only consumers can set in motion
this virtual cycle of increasing demand and

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.510
hiring.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.100
In this sense, an ordinary consumer is
more of a job creator than a capitalist like

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.280
me.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.760
That's why, when business people
take credit for creating jobs,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.939
it's a little bit like squirrels
taking credit for creating evolution.

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.650
It's actually the other way round.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.009
Anyone who's ever run a business knows

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.009
that hiring more people is a
course of last resort for capitalists.

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.780
This is what we do if, and only if
rising consumer demand requires it.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.039
And in this sense, calling ourselves job creators
isn't just inaccurate: it's disingenuous.

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.640
That's why our existing policies
are so upside down.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.050
When the biggest tax exemptions and
the lowest tax rates benefit the richest,

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.510
all in the name of job creation,

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.680
all that happens is that the rich get richer.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.390
Since 1980, the share of income for
the top 1% of Americans has more than tripled,

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.210
while our effective tax rates
have gone down by fifty percent.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.640
If it was true that lower taxes for the rich
and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.420
more wealth for the wealthy led to job creation,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.160
today, we would be drowning in jobs.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.920
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:47.160
And yet, unemployment and
underemployment is at record highs.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.400
Another reason that
this idea is so wrong-headed

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.120
is that there can never be enough
super rich people to power a great economy.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.270
Somebody like me makes 100s, or 1000s
of times as much as the median American.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.590
But I don't buy 100s or 1000s
of times as much stuff.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.730
My family owns three cars, not 3000.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.880
I buy a few pairs of pants and
shirts a year like most American men,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.460
occasionally, we go out to eat with friends.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.840
I can't buy enough of anything
to make up for the fact

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.510
that millions of unemployed
and underemployed Americans

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.080
can't buy any new cars, any clothes,
or enjoy any meals out.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.550
Nor can I make up for the falling consumption
of the vast majority of middle-class families

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.140
that are barely squeaking by,
hurried by spiraling costs,

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.870
and trapped by stagnant or declining wages.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.010
Here's an incredible fact:

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.450
If the typical American family still retained
the same share of income that they did in

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.450
1970,

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.400
they'd earn like 45,000 dollars more a year.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.710
Imagine what our economy
would be like if that were the case.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.000
Significant privileges
have come to people like me,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.630
capitalists, for being perceived as job creators
at the center of the economic universe,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.850
and the language and metaphors we use

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.810
to defend the current economic
and social arrangements is telling.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.450
It's a small jump from "job creator"
to "the creator".

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.450
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.880
This language obviously
wasn't chosen by accident,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.350
and it's only honest to admit that when
somebody like me calls themselves a "job creator",

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.970
we're not just describing
how the economy works,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.530
but more particularly, we're making a claim
on status and privileges that we deserve.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.160
Speaking of special privileges,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.220
the extraordinary differential between
the 15% tax rate that capitalists pay

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.780
on carried interest, dividends, and capital
gains,

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.760
and the 35% top marginal rate
on work that ordinary Americans pay

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.380
is kind of hard to justify
without a touch of deification.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.600
We've had it backwards for the last 30 years.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.410
Rich people like me don't create jobs.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:02.380
Jobs are a consequence of an eco-systemic
feedback loop between customers and businesses.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:09.820
And when the middle class thrives,
businesses grow and hire, and owners profit.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.030
That's why taxing the rich to pay
for investments that benefit all

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.090
is such a fantastic deal
for the middle class and the rich.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.180
So, ladies and gentlemen,
here's an idea worth spreading:

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.130
In a capitalist economy,
the true job creators are middle class consumers

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.250
and taxing the rich to make investments
to make the middle class grow and thrive

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.720
is the single shrewdest thing we can do

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.780
for the middle class, for the poor,
and for the rich.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.780
Thank you.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.781
(Applause)
