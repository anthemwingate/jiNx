00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:44.644

YOU.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:49.515 align:start position:0%
ALL THESE QUESTIONS WILL BE JUMP
BALLS HERE.

YOU ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT YOUR
2009 ANNUAL LETTER.

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:58.458
YOU GUYS PUT OUT A LETTER EVERY
YEAR FOR THE BILL AND MELINDA

00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.192 align:start position:0%
GATES FOUNDATION.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.394
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF A LETTER?

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:02.562 align:start position:0%
WHY A LETTER?

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:03.996
THEY HAVE COMPUTERS NOW, BILL.

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:05.030 size:88% position:44%
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS?

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:08.067 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WELL, EVERY YEAR WE GET TO
SEE A LOT OF THINGS.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.136 align:start position:0%
WE TRAVEL TO AFRICA, WE MEET
WITH SCIENTISTS.

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:16.275
WE SEE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE
GOING VERY WELL, THINGS LIKE

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:19.745 align:start position:0%
REDUCING CHILDHOOD DEATH,
IMPROVING NUTRITION.

00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:22.915 align:start position:0%
IT'S A CHANCE FOR US TO SHARE
WHY WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE WORK

00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:26.686 size:84% position:42%
AND WHERE THINGS ARE GOING.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.655 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND THIS-- THE
THEME THIS YEAR IS?

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:30.856 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SURPRISES.

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:33.960
THINGS THAT HAVE SURPRISED US
THE LAST 20 YEARS, OR EVEN IN

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.228
THIS LAST YEAR IN PARTICULAR.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.496 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY, TELL ME IF
I'M WRONG.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:40.166
PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN YOU FOR YEARS
AS THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:41.033 align:start position:0%
YOU'RE THE SECOND RICHEST MAN IN
THE WORLD, RIGHT?

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:45.471 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WE'RE TRYING TO GIVER IT AWAY
FASTER.

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:49.342 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WILL BEZOS EVEN
TAKE YOUR CALLS AT THIS POINT?

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:53.479 align:start position:0%
<i> ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>
YOU'RE TRYING TO GIVE IT AWAY

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:54.713 align:start position:0%
FASTER.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.182
SEE THAT'S THE SORT OF BEHAVIOR
PEOPLE WANT FROM BILLIONAIRES.

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:59.318 align:start position:0%
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK RIGHT NOW
THAT MAYBE BILLIONAIRES

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:00.085 align:start position:0%
SHOULDN'T EXIST.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
YOU HAVE HEARD SOME OF THIS
TALK?

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:02.454 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE.

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:04.857 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT MAYBE THE
EXISTENCE OF BILLIONAIRES IS A

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.461
FAILURE OF CAPITALISM, BECAUSE
NOT ENOUGH OF THE-- THE CAPITAL

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:12.064 align:start position:0%
GETS CONCENTRATED WITH TOO FEW
PEOPLE.

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:12.498 size:84% position:42%
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THOSE
PEOPLE WHO SAY BILLIONAIRES

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:13.565 align:start position:0%
SHOULDN'T EXIST?

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.906 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WE MIGHT BE BIAS GLD IT'S
POSSIBLE, IT'S POSSIBLE.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.743 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU CAN MAKE THE TAX
SYSTEM TAKE A MUCH HIGHER

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.645 align:start position:0%
PORTION FROM PEOPLE WITH GREAT
WEALTH.

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:27.113 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: 70%?

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:28.147 align:start position:0%
70%.

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:30.716 align:start position:0%
<i> ( APPLAUSE )</i>
&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT'S THE-- THAT'S THE

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:31.917 align:start position:0%
ORDINARY INCOME.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.021
THESE GREAT FORTUNES WERE NOT
MADE THROUGH ORDINARY INCOMES.

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:41.460
SO YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO LOOK TO
THE CAPITAL GAINS RATE AND THE

00:02:41.493 --> 00:02:44.564
ESTATE TAX IF YOU WANT TO, YOU
KNOW, CREATE MORE EQUITY THERE.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:47.033 align:start position:0%
SO I THINK THAT'S A GREAT
DEBATE.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:51.504
I THINK IF YOU GO SO FAR AS TO
SAY THAT THERE'S A TOTAL UPPER

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:55.174 align:start position:0%
LIMIT THAT, THAT MIGHT HAVE MORE
NEGATIVES THAN POSITIVES.

00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:58.578 align:start position:0%
BUT, YOU KNOW, I MAY HAVE A
DISTORTED VIEW OF THIS.

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.413 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU BOTH GO ALL
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:03.249 align:start position:0%
THERE ARE A LOT OF PLACES IN THE
WORLD WHERE THERE ARE MUCH

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:05.351 align:start position:0%
HIGHER TAX RATES, ESPECIALLY FOR
THE MOST WEALTHY.

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:07.420 align:start position:0%
HOW DOES IT WORK OUT IN THOSE
COUNTRIES?

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:08.988
&gt;&gt; NOT NECESSARILY THAT WELL.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:12.191
IN FACT THERE, HAVE BEEN MANY
TIMES WHEN YOU'RE IN FRANCE AND

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:15.695 align:start position:0%
THEY'LL SAY, "GOSH, WE WISH WE
COULD HAVE A BILL GATES.

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:19.198 align:start position:0%
WE WISH WE COULD HAVE SUCH A
VIBE RABBIT TECH SECTOR.

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:21.968 size:88% position:44%
BUT THE TAXES HAVE BEEN DONE
THERE IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.970 align:start position:0%
DISTRIBUTE ACTUALLY STIMULATE
GOOD GROWTH.

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:27.640 size:84% position:42%
SO WE BELIEVE IN A GOOD TAX
SYSTEM THAT SHOULD TAX THE

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:30.042 align:start position:0%
WEALTHY MORE THAN LOW-INCOME
PEOPLE FOR SURE.

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:32.378 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: MORE THAN
PRESENTLY IS BEING TAXED?

00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:32.978 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:33.980 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE OUR VIEW.

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:36.282 align:start position:0%
WE HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST
LOBBYISTS--

00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:40.453 align:start position:0%
<i> ( APPLAUSE )</i>
WE'VE BEEN LOBBYING IN FAVOR OF

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:41.721 size:81% position:41%
INCREASING THE ESTATE TAX.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:44.557
THERE WAS ACTUALLY ONE YEAR THAT
WAS GOOD TO DIE IN BECAUSE THERE

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.992 align:start position:0%
WAS NO ESTATE TAX.

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:46.993 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OH, DAMN IT!

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:48.127 align:start position:0%
I MISSED IT!

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.462 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YOU DID.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:50.763 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER )</i>
BUT THAT COULD BE INCREASED

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.098 align:start position:0%
QUITE A BIT.

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:56.535 align:start position:0%
IT'S LOWER THAN IT USE-- IT USED
TO BE 55%.

00:03:56.568 --> 00:04:01.274
&gt;&gt; WE DO BELIEVE THAT TO WHOM
MUCH IS GIVEN MUCH IS EXPECTED.

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:03.376 align:start position:0%
AND THAT MEANS YOU NEED HAVE--
<i> ( APPLAUSE )</i>

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:08.447
YOU NEED TO HAVE A FAIR TAX
SYSTEM THAT TAXES THE WEALTHY

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:17.790
MORE THAN LOWER-/MIDDLE INCOME,
AND YOU NEED HAVE A VIBRANT PL

00:04:17.823 --> 00:04:18.624 align:start position:0%
PHILANTHROPY SECTOR.

00:04:18.657 --> 00:04:19.858 align:start position:0%
WE CAN TRY THINGS.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:22.595
WE CAN DO INNOVATIONS THAT YOU
WOULDN'T WANT YOUR GOVERNMENT TO

00:04:22.628 --> 00:04:24.764
DO WITH DOLLARS BUT IT HAS TO BE
GOVERNMENT THAT SCALES THINGS UP

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:28.634 size:81% position:41%
LIKE HEALTH AND EDUCATION.

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:29.868 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU SAILED THE
THEME IS SURPRISE.

00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:33.439
WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST SURPRISE OR
MAYBE THE HOPE OF SURPRISES WE

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:34.673 align:start position:0%
WILL SEE IN THE NEWSLETTER THIS
YEAR?

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:38.244 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHAT WE SPEAK ABOUT AROUND
THE WORLD IS A CELL PHONE HAS SO

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:40.746 align:start position:0%
MUCH POWER IN THE HANDS OF A
POOR WOMAN.

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:48.587
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT, WOMEN IN
POOR COUNTRIES WILL TELL YOU

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.256 align:start position:0%
THEY'RE NOT WELCOMED AT THE
BANK.

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.158 align:start position:0%
THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO GET
ON THE BUS TO GO THERE.

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:54.994 align:start position:0%
IF THEY DO, THEY MIGHT GET
ROBBED.

00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:59.699
BUT WHEN SHE CAN SAVE $1 A DAY,
$2 A DAY ON HER CELL PHONE, SHE

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
SPENDS IT ON BEHALF OF HER
FAMILY, ON THEIR HEALTH AND THE

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:04.470 align:start position:0%
EDUCATION OF HER KIDS.

00:05:04.503 --> 00:05:05.471 align:start position:0%
AND SHE ALSO SEES HERSELF
DIFFERENTLY.

00:05:05.504 --> 00:05:07.406 align:start position:0%
SHE STARTS TO SEE HERSELF AS A
WORKING WOMAN.

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:11.510 align:start position:0%
AND SHE'LL TELL YOU, HER HUSBAND
SEES HER DIFFERENTLY WHEN SHE

00:05:11.543 --> 00:05:13.112 align:start position:0%
HAS SAVE THES.

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:16.582 align:start position:0%
SHE'S IN INDIA, HER MOTHER SEES
HER DIFFERENTLY.

00:05:16.615 --> 00:05:20.152 align:start position:0%
IT'S NOT THE ONLY TOOL BUT ONE
OF THE TOOLS THAT WILL HELP

00:05:20.185 --> 00:05:20.652 align:start position:0%
