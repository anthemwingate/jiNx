00:00:08.815 --> 00:00:10.001
Hello, everybody.

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.232
My name is Charlie Cooper,
and I'm nine years old.

00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:15.555
I go to Trinity Beach State School.

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:18.091
I have an idea that is worth spreading.

00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:20.749
If I share with you
a new way to make friends,

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.777
and help people just like me
find confidence,

00:00:23.777 --> 00:00:25.232
would you listen?

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:30.072
Let me tell you a bit about myself.

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:34.782
I was born on the 21st of June, 2005,

00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:37.442
in a small town in New South Wales,

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:38.982
called Narrabri.

00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:42.572
I live at home with mom, dad,
my brother, sister.

00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:45.141
I have two dogs and a bearded dragon.

00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:48.881
I often play with my Lego,

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:52.161
and I love to fly planes
on my dad's flight simulator.

00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:56.476
I'm a quiet kid, and don't often
tell people how I feel.

00:00:56.476 --> 00:00:58.953
But Mom always knows when I am sad.

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:05.529
When I was six years old and in grade two,

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:09.149
my teacher noticed
I was having trouble at school,

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.495
not only with my schoolwork,
but also in making friends.

00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:18.407
After I had my eyes tested,
we found out I was very long-sighted.

00:01:18.437 --> 00:01:22.078
Then I got new glasses,
which helped me with my schoolwork,

00:01:22.078 --> 00:01:23.828
but not with my confidence.

00:01:24.388 --> 00:01:27.435
I got called names,
and this hurt my feelings.

00:01:27.435 --> 00:01:29.268
But I couldn't see without them.

00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:34.854
Around this time,
I didn't have many friends.

00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:37.848
One day, after swimming lessons,

00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:40.868
my school shirt was
even flushed down the toilet.

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.376
This made me feel sad.

00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:47.302
But I still went to school every day,
and tried my hardest,

00:01:47.302 --> 00:01:50.196
even when people would laugh
at my handwriting.

00:01:51.276 --> 00:01:55.847
A year or so later, we went
on a family holiday to America.

00:01:55.847 --> 00:01:59.099
When we were there,
Mom and I read a news article

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:03.746
about a boy who had a similar idea
to help people who had new friends.

00:02:03.986 --> 00:02:06.963
We got home, Christmas came and went,

00:02:06.983 --> 00:02:10.048
and I was still feeling sad
at break times.

00:02:11.753 --> 00:02:14.430
Mom and Dad got me some extra tutoring.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.758
This helped heaps.

00:02:15.758 --> 00:02:20.250
And I also repeated grade two,
which at the time made me sad.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.599
I found it hard to play with other kids,

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.699
so I ended up playing on my own
at the library with the bricks.

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:31.985
From there, I wrote a letter,

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:35.136
which a kind man from school called Lee

00:02:35.136 --> 00:02:38.246
handed the letter
to the local hardware store.

00:02:38.246 --> 00:02:40.075
They thought the idea was great,

00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:44.080
and ended up supplying all the wood
and varnish for the project.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.762
Then Lee took the letter
to the Men's Shed.

00:02:47.762 --> 00:02:51.054
They were also very excited
to help out with the project,

00:02:51.054 --> 00:02:54.114
and built the bench
for our school, free of charge.

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.516
This idea is one worth spreading.

00:02:57.516 --> 00:03:01.908
It's such a simple idea to create
friendship and eliminate loneliness.

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:06.986
The idea is that if someone is sad
or has no friends to play with,

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.230
they can sit on the bench.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.413
And the whole school knows
this friendship bench has a purpose.

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:16.035
If someone is on the bench,

00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:20.885
then other children in the playground
are going to invite that child to play,

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:23.545
or ask them if they want to walk and talk.

00:03:23.775 --> 00:03:27.613
My school principal has told
everybody the rule of the bench,

00:03:27.613 --> 00:03:30.051
and it's monitored by teachers, too.

00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:35.311
The thing is, with people's help
and your own hard work,

00:03:35.311 --> 00:03:37.181
anything is possible,

00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:40.145
even if you think it's not sometimes.

00:03:40.145 --> 00:03:43.955
I would like to see a buddy bench
in every school in Australia.

00:03:45.795 --> 00:03:49.223
That way children
won't have to feel how I felt.

00:03:49.223 --> 00:03:51.473
The bench acts as a friendship tool

00:03:51.473 --> 00:03:53.831
to help people in making friends.

00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:55.745
The bench is now used daily

00:03:55.745 --> 00:03:59.385
all because I brought this idea
to my principal's attention.

00:04:01.805 --> 00:04:04.948
The bench encourages
this happy, safe place,

00:04:04.948 --> 00:04:07.561
a place where kids
can feel safe and welcome.

00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:10.133
This is what my school is,

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:12.983
a school where the word
"bullying" is not used,

00:04:12.983 --> 00:04:16.143
but where happy and safe play
is encouraged.

00:04:17.113 --> 00:04:21.244
Now it may be small, but I believe
that little people just like me

00:04:21.244 --> 00:04:23.714
can really make
a big difference in the world

00:04:23.714 --> 00:04:28.574
if some wood, hammer and nails
can make people feel special and included.

00:04:28.574 --> 00:04:31.404
And this really is an idea
that is worth spreading.

00:04:32.834 --> 00:04:34.407
Thank you for your time.

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:36.407
(Applause)
