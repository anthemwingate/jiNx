00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.749
Ezra Klein: So in 2015 I asked you what you
were afraid of.

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:07.900
Bill Gates: The big worry for me – I would
say even a likelihood during my lifetime is

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.010
a big epidemic.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.200
Klein: So let me ask you the reverse of it.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.850
I'm thinking three or five years into the
future beyond just a vaccine.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.800
What are you hopeful for?

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.950
What do you hope for?

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.390
Gates: Well, I hope that this draws the world
together.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.830
I mean after World War II

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.140
we created new institutions and we successfully
avoided having another world war.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.750
And that's a phenomenal thing.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.120
We haven't blown off a nuclear weapon as part
of a conflict.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.600
We did that by binding ourselves together
through a variety of institutions –&nbsp;including

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.700
WHO on health.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.900
Archival narrator: “Churchill Roosevelt
and Stalin dedicated their nations to the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.960
foundations for permanent peace for a United
Nations organization”

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.960
Here –

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.420
"It felt like I was working in a warzone."

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.829
"They all have Covid."

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.530
This is a tragic event.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.860
Whatever good comes out of this will in no
way make up for the problems that it causes.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.820
The disease got into exponential growth in
a lot of Europe and the United States.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.500
And so the toll there is greater than I would
have expected.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.560
You know, we're learning about how to do testing
well.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.409
A lot of countries got that right and did
it very early on.

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.500
I think part of it is that the minor epidemics
we had really didn't hit the US.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.200
So if you look at the Asian countries that
did well,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.659
places like Taiwan or South Korea

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.780
because they were hit with MERS or SARS.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.780
They had the playbook.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.780
They opened the playbook.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.369
And they went through those steps.

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.090
many of them wrote down, you know, step one,
identify all PCR machines, step two get supplies

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.090
for PCR machines.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.850
You know, we haven't done that in a reasonable
way today.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.512
We don't really know what's going to happen
in developing countries where most of the

00:01:56.512 --> 00:01:58.000
world population lives.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.979
But, unless there's some magical factor, the
likelihood that the vast majority of the deaths

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.070
will be there is very high.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.720
It's harder for them to socially isolate and
they need to get food.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.670
There isn't this ability to do what we've
done.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.080
"People are suffering."

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.830
"There is no income.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.520
Life is so hard."

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.209
It should say to us, OK.

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.480
This science is important.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.090
Let's use it to avoid pandemics.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.300
The U.S. Congress – that allocates resources
– has been the most generous on HIV funding

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.610
for the entire world.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.620
You know, it started under a Republican administration.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.300
George W. Bush: "And to meet a severe and
urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.550
emergency plan for AIDS relief."

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.190
Gates: You know, the US government has helped
the health of the entire world.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.210
Been a huge part of the reduction in death.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:52.040
And so I do think what you're seeing in this
short term, in terms of how the U.S. is engaging...

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.530
Trump: "… to halt funding of the World Health
Organization while a review is conducted."

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.730
Gates: ...it's not where we'll end up.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.780
I don't see a change in the US Congress and
saying, hey, in this case, not only is it

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.780
humanitarian,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.569
It's about strategic relationships and it's
about making sure the disease isn't coming

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.700
back into the US as we participate in global
commerce that we benefit immensely from.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.580
You know, everybody brings to the epidemic
their hopes that maybe they had before.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.959
And I've always believed in global cooperation…

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.959
That human ability to take a much worse situation

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.960
and craft it into the institutions and the
economic growth and innovation

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.819
that we’ve had between World War II and
now –

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:45.840
I hope that this looks like that.
