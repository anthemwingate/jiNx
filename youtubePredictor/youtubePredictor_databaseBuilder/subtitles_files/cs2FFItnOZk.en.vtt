00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.346
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Rodney Dangerfield.

00:00:05.346 --> 00:00:06.488
(applause)

00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:09.071
(upbeat music)

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:18.929
- Thank you so much.

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.113
What a crowd, what a crowd!

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.690
Nice tuxedo, huh?

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.265
Underneath, torn underwear.

00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:27.070
(laughing)

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.720
First, I'd like to say,
thanks, to the people here

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.553
at the Academy.

00:00:29.553 --> 00:00:30.550
They've been very nice.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.160
Before the show, they introduced
me to a lovely young lady

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.230
and they told me if I needed anything,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.050
she's here to help me,
and she'll be with me

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.380
until the show is over.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.620
Very nice, huh?

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.850
Just when I need her, they send her home.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.200
(laughing)

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.350
No laughs, just cute
stuff, that's all I do.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.330
I'm here tonight to present
the award for makeup.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.440
Makeup is important.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.920
In movies, everybody want
to look good, you know,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.980
and who always wins the
award, the guy who creates

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.571
the ugliest creature there is.

00:00:56.571 --> 00:00:58.520
(laughing)

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.370
People all want to look good.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.950
It makes them feel better.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.280
When my wife went out,
she had her face lifted.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.213
My luck, there was one
just like it underneath.

00:01:05.213 --> 00:01:07.463
(laughing)

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.470
Just a joke, a joke.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.303
I'm kidding.

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:12.520
I'm not married, not married.

00:01:14.089 --> 00:01:14.922
Where was I, makeup.

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:15.790
Know, makeup is important.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.860
Although last week I met a girl,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.720
makeup didn't help her at all.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.013
I mean, this girl was ugly.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:21.422
- [Man In Audience] How ugly?

00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:22.810
(laughing)

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.360
- How ugly?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.819
When she goes to the bank,
they turn off the cameras.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:27.765
Ugly, are you kiddin'?

00:01:27.765 --> 00:01:30.015
(laughing)

00:01:31.213 --> 00:01:32.046
I mean ugly.

00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:34.919
She went to a plastic
surgeon, he added a tail.

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:37.169
(laughing)

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.330
All right.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.163
Ugly, you kiddin'?

00:01:40.163 --> 00:01:42.081
When she walks in the
room, mice jump on chairs.

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:44.331
(laughing)

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.410
You know what, I take it all back.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.100
Looks are not that important.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.490
It's what's underneath
what counts, soul, depth,

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.290
that's what's important, not looks.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.810
Now how many times you
take a walk in a street,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.460
you see a tall, handsome
man walking arm in arm

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.173
with a short, fat, ugly girl.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.913
I never saw that.

00:02:02.913 --> 00:02:03.746
Did you ever see that?

00:02:03.746 --> 00:02:04.758
I never saw it, you know?

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:06.500
(laughing)

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.857
I thought I saw that, you know.

00:02:07.857 --> 00:02:08.690
(clapping)

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.523
We'll get to the award now.

00:02:09.523 --> 00:02:11.510
For the best achievement in makeup,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.110
the nominees are:

00:02:15.851 --> 00:02:17.442
The Clan of the Cave Bear,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.413
Michael G. Westmore and Michele Burke.

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:24.220
I'll tell ya, you've got to watch out

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.677
for those single bars.

00:02:25.677 --> 00:02:27.927
(laughing)

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.900
The Fly, Chris Walas and Stephan Dupuis.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.150
(applause)

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.327
Now I know why they
invented the flyswatter.

00:02:38.327 --> 00:02:40.577
(laughing)

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.583
Legend, Rob Bottin and Peter Robb-King.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.907
This reminds me of the last
time I called an escort service.

00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:51.157
(laughing)

00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:55.174
And the winner for the best
achievement in makeup is

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.327
Chris Walas and Stephan
Dupuis for The Fly.

(applause)
