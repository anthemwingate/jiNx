00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:08.746
Your timing made you and your partner

00:00:08.746 --> 00:00:11.576
the most infamous bank robbers 
in the west.

00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:15.766
Now, you’ll need to use that timing 
to help you break out of jail.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:20.508
At the appointed time, you’ll be walking 
in the yard near the electric fence.

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.499
Your partner will flash you the signal,

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.019
and exactly 45 seconds later,

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.529
short out the fence circuit.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.769
It’ll automatically restart 
after a second or two,

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.649
but as long as you move fast,

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.349
you’ll be home free.

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:35.739
And then you notice,

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:36.899
to your horror,

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.489
that your watch is broken,

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.159
and there’s no time to fix it.

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:41.329
The signal is coming,

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.769
and if you make even a small mistake 
in counting off 45 seconds,

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.760
you’ll get fried.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.990
Searching your pockets,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.290
you find something that might help:

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.320
a lighter and two fuses you made earlier 
in the prison work program.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.430
Each fuse is a length of flammable twine,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.250
built to be lit on either end 
and burn for precisely one minute.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.650
The problem is that even though 
the fuses look uniform,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.470
they don’t burn evenly,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.870
so if you cut one in half, for example,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.200
one side might burn longer than the other.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.710
Your partner is going to give 
the signal any minute,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.430
and you’ll have to make your move.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.610
How can you use the fuses and lighter 
to time exactly 45 seconds?

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.500
Pause the video to figure it out yourself.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.602
Answer in 3

00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:33.842
Answer in 2

00:01:33.842 --> 00:01:35.012
Answer in 1

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:37.702
The length of the fuse may 
not tell you anything,

00:01:37.702 --> 00:01:43.052
but you do know the fuses take exactly
60 seconds to burn from end to end.

00:01:43.052 --> 00:01:44.412
Here’s the key insight:

00:01:44.412 --> 00:01:48.682
If you start a fuse on one side 
and it burns for 30 seconds,

00:01:48.682 --> 00:01:52.192
there’ll still be 30 seconds of fuse left.

00:01:52.192 --> 00:01:54.142
If you had started it from the other end,

00:01:54.142 --> 00:01:58.092
it would’ve reached the exact 
same spot in thirty seconds.

00:01:58.092 --> 00:02:01.712
That means that if you lit it 
from both ends simultaneously,

00:02:01.712 --> 00:02:05.162
it would burn out in precisely 30 seconds.

00:02:05.162 --> 00:02:08.022
But how will you time the last fifteen?

00:02:08.022 --> 00:02:10.662
That’ll have to come from the second fuse.

00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:12.542
If it were a 30 second fuse,

00:02:12.542 --> 00:02:14.832
you’d be able to use that same trick again

00:02:14.832 --> 00:02:19.772
to double the burning speed and 
make it last exactly 15 seconds.

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:22.937
And, you realize, you can 
shorten the second fuse

00:02:22.937 --> 00:02:27.197
by lighting one end of it at the same time
as you light the first.

00:02:27.197 --> 00:02:29.337
At the moment the first burns out,

00:02:29.337 --> 00:02:33.167
you’ll be left with 30 seconds 
on the second fuse.

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:35.197
Just when you’ve got this all figured out,

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:37.037
you see the signal from your partner,

00:02:37.037 --> 00:02:38.767
and spring into action.

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:43.037
You gather the four ends of the two 
fuses and light three of them.

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:44.843
The moment the first burns out,

00:02:44.843 --> 00:02:47.883
you light the other end 
of the second fuse.

00:02:47.883 --> 00:02:49.403
When it flickers and dies,

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:52.613
you know that exactly 45 
seconds have passed,

00:02:52.613 --> 00:02:55.503
and the electric fence is dead.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.688
By the time it hiccups back to life,

00:02:57.688 --> 00:03:00.518
you’re over the fence and home free.
