00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:21.226
Hear that?

00:00:21.762 --> 00:00:24.027
That's nothing.

00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:28.381
Which is what I, as a speaker
at today's conference,

00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:29.816
have for you all.

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:32.460
I have nothing.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.724
Nada.

00:00:33.724 --> 00:00:34.819
Zip.

00:00:34.827 --> 00:00:36.277
Zilch.

00:00:36.277 --> 00:00:37.407
Zippo.

00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:40.360
Nothing smart. Nothing inspirational.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.688
Nothing even remotely researched at all.

00:00:43.688 --> 00:00:47.147
I have absolutely
nothing to say whatsoever.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:52.178
And yet, through my manner of speaking,
I will make it seem like I do.

00:00:53.238 --> 00:00:55.879
Like what I am saying is brilliant.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.769
And maybe, just maybe, you will feel
like you've learned something.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.986
Now, I'm going to get started
with the opening.

00:01:04.986 --> 00:01:06.935
I'm going to make 
a lot of hand gestures.

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:10.091
I'm going to do this with my right hand,
I'm going to do this with my left.

00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:11.803
I'm going to adjust my glasses.

00:01:11.803 --> 00:01:13.951
And then I'm going to ask you all
a question.

00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:17.502
By a show of hands, how many of you all
have been asked a question before?

00:01:17.502 --> 00:01:18.490
(Laughter)

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.170
Okay, great, I'm seeing some hands.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.150
And again, I have nothing here.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.764
Now, I'm gonna react to that

00:01:24.764 --> 00:01:27.910
and act like I'm telling you
a personal anecdote.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.144
Something to break the tension.

00:01:30.144 --> 00:01:32.731
Something to endear myself a little bit.

00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:36.113
Something kind of embarrassing.

00:01:38.257 --> 00:01:41.394
And you guys 
are going to make an "aw" sound.

00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:44.351
It's true. It really happened.

00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:45.336
(Laughter)

00:01:45.336 --> 00:01:47.518
And now I'm going to bring it
to a broader point.

00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:49.511
I'm going to really beckon.

00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:52.549
I'm going to make it intellectual.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.122
I'm going to bring it to this man
right here.

00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:59.796
Now, what this man did
was important, I'm sure.

00:01:59.796 --> 00:02:01.382
(Laughter)

00:02:01.382 --> 00:02:04.526
But I, for one,
have no idea who he is.

00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:07.502
I simply googled image
the word "Scientist."

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:08.407
(Laughter)

00:02:08.407 --> 00:02:11.734
And now you see, I'd like it to seem
like I'm making points,

00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:13.114
building an argument,

00:02:13.114 --> 00:02:16.518
inspiring you to change your life,
when in reality,

00:02:16.518 --> 00:02:17.629
this is just

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.020
me...

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.161
buying...

00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:20.999
time...

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.973
Now, if you don't believe me,
let's take a look at the numbers.

00:02:23.973 --> 00:02:26.908
This is a real thing
that's happening right now.

00:02:26.908 --> 00:02:30.524
The number of talks
that I'm giving is one.

00:02:30.524 --> 00:02:32.832
Interesting facts imparted
thus far in said talk,

00:02:32.832 --> 00:02:34.925
well, that's going to be a zero.

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:39.484
My height in inches is 70.5.
Note the .5 there.

00:02:39.484 --> 00:02:41.178
2x6 equals 12.

00:02:41.178 --> 00:02:43.842
And then interestingly enough
6x2 also equals 12.

00:02:43.842 --> 00:02:45.528
That's math.

00:02:46.748 --> 00:02:50.054
352 is a three-digit number

00:02:50.054 --> 00:02:55.262
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then almost immediately
following that we get 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:02:56.455 --> 00:02:57.855
Now, to add more filler here,

00:02:57.855 --> 00:03:00.439
I'm going to give you
a couple more number to consider,

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.202
uh ... 18.

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:03.936
237.

00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:06.157
5,601.

00:03:06.157 --> 00:03:08.837
2.6 million.

00:03:08.837 --> 00:03:10.038
Four.

00:03:10.038 --> 00:03:11.204
Four.

00:03:11.204 --> 00:03:14.094
24. Staggering!

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:15.064
(Laughter)

00:03:15.064 --> 00:03:17.593
These are real numbers, all of them.

00:03:17.593 --> 00:03:20.224
And to follow that up,
let's take a look at some graphs.

00:03:20.224 --> 00:03:23.236
Now, if you take a look at this pie chart,
what you're going to see

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:26.313
is that the majority
far exceeds the minority.

00:03:26.313 --> 00:03:29.604
Everybody see that? Cool, isn't it?

00:03:29.604 --> 00:03:31.608
And let's take a look at this bar graph,

00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:34.248
'cause it shows similarly irrelevant data.

00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:37.570
Now, I'm doing this because
I'd like to make it seem

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.280
like I've done my homework.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.222
If you were, say, watching this
on YouTube with the sound off,

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:47.124
you might think, "Ah, okay.
This guy knows what he's talking about."

00:03:47.124 --> 00:03:48.927
But I don't.

00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:51.609
I'm floundering, panicking.
I've got nothing.

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.751
I'm a total and utter phony.

00:03:53.751 --> 00:03:55.326
But you know what?

00:03:55.326 --> 00:03:57.083
I was offered a TED Talk.

00:03:57.083 --> 00:03:59.722
And dammit, I'm gonna see it through.

00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:01.532
(Laughter)

00:04:01.532 --> 00:04:03.233
Now, if you take a look behind me,

00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:08.329
these are just words paired with
vaguely thought-provoking stock photos.

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.780
I'm going to point at them

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.443
like I'm making use
both of my time as well as your time.

00:04:12.443 --> 00:04:15.567
But in reality, I don't know
what half of them mean.

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:19.048
And now, as these continue,
I'm just going to start saying gibberish.

00:04:19.048 --> 00:04:21.603
Wagga wah, gabba gabba.

00:04:21.603 --> 00:04:24.377
Turkey, mouth and a mouth.

00:04:24.377 --> 00:04:27.259
Chip, trip, my dog Skip.

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.389
Rip it and dip it, Richard.

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.189
I'm an itty-bitty baby bopper.

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:33.322
And I'm hungry in my tum tum.

00:04:33.322 --> 00:04:36.173
Brad Pitt, Uma Thurman.

00:04:36.173 --> 00:04:37.786
Names, things.

00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:39.845
Words, words and more things.

00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:43.552
And see? It feels like it might
make sense, doesn't it?

00:04:43.552 --> 00:04:44.836
Like maybe, just maybe,

00:04:44.836 --> 00:04:47.236
I'm building to some sort of
satisfying conclusion,

00:04:47.236 --> 00:04:49.491
I mean, I'm gesticulating as though I am.

00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:51.305
I'm pacing, I'm growing in intensity,

00:04:51.305 --> 00:04:54.285
I'm taking off my glasses,
which by the way, are just frames.

00:04:54.285 --> 00:04:57.007
(Laughter)

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.171
I wore them to look smart,

00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:06.266
even though my vision is perfect.

00:05:07.462 --> 00:05:10.111
And now I'm going to slow things down
a little bit.

00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:13.025
I'm going to change the tone.

00:05:13.025 --> 00:05:18.618
I'm going to make it seem
like I'm building to a moment.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.524
And what if I was?

00:05:22.524 --> 00:05:24.699
(Laughter)

00:05:24.702 --> 00:05:26.658
Amazing, isn't it? What can we do?

00:05:26.658 --> 00:05:29.128
Life's a roller coaster.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.617
You know, if there's one thing
you'd take away from my talk,

00:05:35.617 --> 00:05:38.435
I'd like you to think about
what you heard at the beginning,

00:05:38.435 --> 00:05:42.489
and I'd like you to think
about what you hear now.

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:44.412
Because it was nothing

00:05:44.412 --> 00:05:47.425
and it's still nothing, think about that.

00:05:47.425 --> 00:05:49.488
Or don't, that's fine.

00:05:49.488 --> 00:05:52.217
And now I'm going to stop talking.

00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:53.601
Thank you.

00:05:53.601 --> 00:05:55.400
(Applause)
