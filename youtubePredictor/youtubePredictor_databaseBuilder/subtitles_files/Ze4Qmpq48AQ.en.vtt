00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:08.758
It begins with a bit of discomfort

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:12.347
and soon becomes a pressing sensation
that's impossible to ignore.

00:00:12.347 --> 00:00:14.161
Finally, it's all you can think about,

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:15.557
and out of sheer desperation,

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:21.191
you go on a hunt for a bathroom
until "ahh."

00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:24.378
Humans should urinate at least
four to six times a day,

00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:28.678
but occasionally, the pressures of modern
life forces us to clench and hold it in.

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:32.329
How bad is this habit,
and how long can our bodies withstand it?

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.589
The answers lie in the workings
of the bladder,

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:37.280
an oval pouch 
that sits inside the pelvis.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.568
Surrounding this structure 
are several other organs

00:00:40.568 --> 00:00:43.460
that together make up the whole
urinary system.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.599
Two kidneys,

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:45.939
two ureters,

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:48.030
two urethral sphincters,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.039
and a urethra.

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.110
Constantly trickling down from the kidneys
is the yellowish liquid known as urine.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.779
The kidneys make urine from a mix
of water and the body's waste products,

00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:03.211
funneling the unwanted fluid
into two muscular tubes called ureters.

00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:07.250
These carry it downward into
the hollow organ known as the bladder.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.591
This organ's muscular wall is made of
tissue called detrusor muscle

00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:16.769
which relaxes as the bladder fills
allowing it to inflate like a balloon.

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:19.820
As the bladder gets full, 
the detrusor contracts.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.041
The internal urethral sphincter
automatically and involuntarily opens,

00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:26.711
and the urine is released.

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:29.263
Whooshing downwards, 
the fluid enters the urethra

00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:32.210
and stops short at the external
urethral sphincter.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.861
This works like a tap.

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:37.070
When you want to delay urinating,
you keep the sphincter closed.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.570
When you want to release it,
you can voluntarily open the flood gates.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.800
But how do you sense 
your bladder's fullness

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.400
so you know when to pee?

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.181
Inside the layers of detrusor muscles
are millions of stretch receptors

00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:50.420
that get triggered as the bladder fills.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.792
They send signals along your nerves
to the sacral region in your spinal cord.

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:57.052
A reflex signal travels back to
your bladder,

00:01:57.052 --> 00:01:59.400
making the detrusor muscle 
contract slightly

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.103
and increasing the bladder's pressure
so you're aware that it's filling up.

00:02:03.103 --> 00:02:06.832
Simultaneously, the internal 
urethral sphincter opens.

00:02:06.832 --> 00:02:08.962
This is called the micturition reflex.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.754
The brain can counter it if it's not
a good time to urinate

00:02:11.754 --> 00:02:16.282
by sending another signal to contract
the external urethral sphincter.

00:02:16.282 --> 00:02:20.021
With about 150 to 200 milliliters of urine
inside of it,

00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:22.311
the bladder's muscular wall 
is stretched enough

00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:24.363
for you to sense 
that there's urine within.

00:02:24.363 --> 00:02:28.554
At about 400 to 500 milliliters,
the pressure becomes uncomfortable.

00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:31.233
The bladder can go on stretching,
but only to a point.

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:33.742
Above 1,000 milliliters, it may burst.

00:02:33.742 --> 00:02:36.574
Most people would lose bladder
control before this happens,

00:02:36.574 --> 00:02:37.973
but in very rare cases,

00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:40.662
such as when as a person can't sense
the need to urinate,

00:02:40.662 --> 00:02:44.823
the pouch can rupture painfully
requiring surgery to fix.

00:02:44.823 --> 00:02:46.523
But under normal circumstances,

00:02:46.523 --> 00:02:50.583
your decision to urinate stops the brain's
signal to the external urethral sphincter,

00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:53.424
causing it to relax 
and the bladder to empty.

00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:56.963
The external urethral sphincter
is one of the muscles of the pelvic floor,

00:02:56.963 --> 00:02:59.933
and it provides support to the urethra
and bladder neck.

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:02.143
It's lucky we have these 
pelvic floor muscles

00:03:02.143 --> 00:03:04.833
because placing pressure on the system
by coughing,

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:05.625
sneezing,

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:06.462
laughing,

00:03:06.462 --> 00:03:09.085
or jumping could cause bladder leakage.

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:11.852
Instead, the pelvic floor muscles
keep the region sealed

00:03:11.852 --> 00:03:13.574
until you're ready to go.

00:03:13.574 --> 00:03:15.124
But holding it in for too long,

00:03:15.124 --> 00:03:17.254
forcing out your urine too fast,

00:03:17.254 --> 00:03:19.634
or urinating without proper
physical support

00:03:19.634 --> 00:03:24.244
may over time weaken or overwork
that muscular sling.

00:03:24.244 --> 00:03:26.475
That can lead to an overactive
pelvic floor,

00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:27.663
bladder pain,

00:03:27.663 --> 00:03:28.621
urgency,

00:03:28.621 --> 00:03:30.785
or urinary incontinence.

00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:32.726
So in the interest of long-term health,

00:03:32.726 --> 00:03:34.736
it's not a great habit to hold your pee.

00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:38.376
But in the short term, at least,
your body and brain have got you covered,

00:03:38.376 --> 00:03:41.314
so you can conveniently choose
your moment of sweet release.
