00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:09.687
Without substantial change, getting the greenhouse gas emissions down,

00:00:09.787 --> 00:00:15.027
we are on a path to large increases in the planet’s temperature.

00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:21.867
You hear a lot about the progress in reducing the cost of renewable energy to make electricity.

00:00:22.113 --> 00:00:26.073
But generating electricity isn’t the only contributor to climate change.

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:30.913
It accounts for only about 25 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.240
With greenhouse gases you have the electricity sector.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.400
But you also have manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, buildings,

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:43.033
as well as about 10% from other sources.

00:00:43.473 --> 00:00:44.833
We need innovation

00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:51.433
going out there and finding inventors across all these different areas and understanding their energy R&amp;D activities

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:57.173
to make sure that they have a path from their laboratory to scaling up into very large numbers.

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.493
For electricity,

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:02.993
wind energy and solar energy prices are coming down.

00:01:03.373 --> 00:01:07.913
So the electricity sector has to either be able to store that energy

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:13.333
or have other zero-emission sources to maintain the reliability that we all depend on.

00:01:13.693 --> 00:01:15.573
Manufacturing

00:01:15.613 --> 00:01:18.053
Here we're talking about all the stuff we buy:

00:01:18.227 --> 00:01:22.467
furniture, beds, the cars themselves, all of those things.

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:26.707
Just the very process of making cement is CO2 emitting.

00:01:26.747 --> 00:01:28.927
There’s a lot of embedded energy.

00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:31.927
We'll have to change the way that we do that manufacturing.

00:01:32.147 --> 00:01:34.367
Transportation

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.960
Immediately people think about passenger cars.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.920
And they are a big part of that. But transportation is quite broad.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.340
We've got railroads. We've got ships.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.320
We've got planes. And so every one of those has to get to zero emission.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.160
Agriculture.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.900
This is a category that often people forget about.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.600
Cows actually emit quite a bit of methane which is one of the more powerful greenhouse gases.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.020
And so, inventions like artificial meat may have to play a role here.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.180
Buildings.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:15.120
We need to invent different processes in order to get the energy used in running all these buildings down, way down, to zero.

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:20.767
The path to success is going to require innovation across every one of these sectors.

00:02:20.887 --> 00:02:22.647
So it is quite daunting.

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:26.847
During this century we not only need to invent all of these things,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.900
we actually need to deploy them at massive, massive scale.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.960
But in my experience innovation can do magical things.
