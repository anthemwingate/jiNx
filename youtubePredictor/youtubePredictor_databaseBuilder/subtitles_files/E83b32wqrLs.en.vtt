&gt;&gt; Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY!

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:07.907 align:start position:0%
WE'RE BACK WITH THE AUTHOR OF
"HOW TO AVOID A CLIMATE

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.510 align:start position:0%
DISASTER," BILL GATES.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:14.313
GOVERNOR ABBOTT DOWN IN TEXAS
SAYS THEIR PROBLEM WAS GREEN

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:15.514 align:start position:0%
ENERGY DOWN IN TEXAS.

00:00:15.547 --> 00:00:18.284 align:start position:0%
THAT'S WHY THEY DIDN'T HAVE
POWER, SO THE WATER SYSTEM SHUT

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:26.125 align:start position:0%
DOWN AND THE HEATERS SHUT DOWN
AND THE PIPES BURST.

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:29.695
WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO SOMEONE
WHO WANTS TO BLAME GREEN ENERGY

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:30.896 size:75% position:38%
FOR THERE LATEST CRISIS?

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.400
&gt;&gt; WELL, THE PROBLEM WAS THEY
DIDN'T WEATHERIZE ANY OF THEIR

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:37.437
POWER SOURCES, SO NATURAL GAS
SHUT DOWN, AND THAT WAS THE

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
BIGGEST THING.

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.907
THE WIND SHUTTING DOWN WAS A
VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE, AND THAT

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.410 align:start position:0%
WAS JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T
WEATHERIZED IT.

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:47.914 align:start position:0%
EVEN NORTH DAKOTA HAS WIND THAT
WORKS AT COLD TEMPERATURES.

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:51.184
THERE ARE TWO REALLY VALID
POINTS HERE, THOUGH, WHICH IS

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:54.587 align:start position:0%
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE OF
THESE CRAZY WEATHER EVENTS, EVEN

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.391
COLD ONES LIKE THAT, BECAUSE OF
CLIMATE CHANGE, AND, AS WE MAKE

00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:02.962 align:start position:0%
THE GRID CLEAN, IT IS -- IT WILL
BE A CHALLENGE TO KEEP IT

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:06.299
RELIABLE BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE
LOTS OF CASES WHERE THERE'S NOT

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:10.403
MUCH SUN OR WIND, SO WE HAVE TO
INNOVATE TO BE ABLE TO STORE

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
ENERGY OR USE A
WEATHER-INDEPENDENT GREEN SOURCE

00:01:14.373 --> 00:01:14.807 align:start position:0%
LIKE NUCLEAR.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.742 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY.

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:21.714
WELL, I MEAN, PEOPLE LOOK AT
NUCLEAR A LITTLE ASKANCE, AND

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:24.083
I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
THERE HAVE BEEN NUCLEAR
ACCIDENTS.

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:31.657
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU SAW H.B.O.'S
SHEERS CHERNOBYL, BUT IT WAS A

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.460 align:start position:0%
BIT CHILLING, ABOUT THE
POSSIBILITY THERE WOULD BE A

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:40.299 size:88% position:44%
LARGE HUNK OF EASTERN EUROPE
WOULD NOT BE INHABITABLE FOR

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS.

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:46.472 align:start position:0%
IS IT POSSIBLE TO DO NUCLEAR
POWER SAFELY?

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:49.375 align:start position:0%
WE NEED A NEW DESIGN.

00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:53.713
THE RECORD, DESPITE CHERNOBYL,
DESPITE WHAT COAL HAS DONE TO

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:56.883 align:start position:0%
PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND COAL MINUS
AND NATURAL GAS PIPELINES

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.719 align:start position:0%
BLOWING UP, IT'S QUITE GOOD, BUT
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:04.423 align:start position:0%
SO WE NEED TO START FROM SCRATCH
AND HAVE A REACTOR THAT THE

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:08.261
OPERATES CAN NEVER MESS UP, THAT
NO MATTER WHAT, THE RADIOACTIVE

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:14.033
STUFF STAYS ON SITE, AND I'M
INVOLVED IN A COMPANY THAT JUST

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:18.070
GOT A U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT
TO PROVE THAT THERE'S THIS NEW

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
SUPER SAFE GENERATION.

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:23.976 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: UM, NOT TO PUSH
BACK AGAINST SOMEONE WHO KNOWS

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.680
MORE ABOUT THIS THAN I DO, BUT
ISN'T THE DANGER WITH NUCLEAR

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:30.216 align:start position:0%
REACTORS NOT SO MUCH THAT OTHER
FORMS OF ENERGY DON'T KILL

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:35.354 align:start position:0%
PEOPLE IN THE LONG RUN, BUT THAT
A LARGE CHUNK OF THE PLANET

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:39.559
DOESN'T BECOME UNINHABITABLE AS
A RESULT OF AN ACCIDENT WHEN

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:46.399
NUCLEAR RADIATION IS SPREAD LIKE
A POISONOUS SAUCE OVER UKRAINE?

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:53.873
&gt;&gt; NO, THE CHERNOBYL WAS A HUGE
DISASTER, AND, YOU KNOW, THE

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:57.410
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL SPREAD OUT
OF THE REACTOR, AND, YOU KNOW,

00:02:57.443 --> 00:03:00.913
PEOPLE HAD TO LEAVE THAT AREA.

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:05.017 align:start position:0%
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO KEEP
THE STUFF IN THE REACTOR.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.489 size:88% position:44%
IT IS, YOU KNOW -- IT -- THE
HISTORY IS CLEAR, BUT, GOING

00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:14.594
FORWARD, PEOPLE SHOULD JUST HAVE
AN OPEN MIND BECAUSE YOU WANT A

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:19.265
GREEN SOURCE OF ENERGY THAT'S
NOT WEATHER DEPENDENT, AND

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:23.202
NUCLEAR IS THE ONLY THING THAT
HAS A CHANCE OF SCALING THAT

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:26.806
WELL, AND, YOU KNOW, I'M AMAZED
AT THE BRILLIANT THINGS PEOPLE

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:31.444
HAVE COME UP WITH TO BE ABLE TO
GUARANTEE THIS, AND NOW WE CAN

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:35.047
SIMULATE ALL THE BAD THINGS THAT
MGHT HAPPEN TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.248 align:start position:0%
ROBUST.

00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:40.586 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AT 65 YEARS OLD,
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:47.493 align:start position:0%
SAY TO THIS GUY FROM 37 YEARS
AGO?

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:49.428
YOU SEE THIS FELLOW RIGHT HERE?

00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:50.596 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HE WAS A MAD MAN.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:51.897 align:start position:0%
HE WORKED ALL THE TIME.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.335
HE DIDN'T THINK OLD PEOPLE HAD
ANY GOOD IDEAS, SO I WOULD TELL

00:03:56.368 --> 00:04:00.273 size:84% position:42%
THEM TO MELLOW ON THAT ONE.

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:01.874 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ARE THERE ANY

00:04:01.907 --> 00:04:06.879 align:start position:0%
THINGS YOU WOULD SAY LIKE, DON'T
DO THAT, DON'T PURSUE THAT

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:07.746 align:start position:0%
PROJECT?

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.914 align:start position:0%
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD WAVE
HIM OFF.

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:10.483
&gt;&gt; BE NICE TO THE GOVERNMENT.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:13.819 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BE NICE TO THE
GOVERNMENT?

00:04:13.852 --> 00:04:14.853 align:start position:0%
WHY?

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:16.555 align:start position:0%
WAS THIS GUY JUST A LITTLE CREEP
TO THE GOVERNMENT?

00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:20.059 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, HE EVENTUALLY GOT
INTO AN ANTITRUST TRIAL.

00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:21.260
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:22.862 align:start position:0%
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:29.235 align:start position:0%
AND WAS HE RIGHT OR WRONG FOR
DEFENDING HIS ACTIONS?

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:33.539 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; UH, I'M TOO BIASED TO ANSWER
THAT QUESTION.

00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:37.643 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU'RE IMMINENTLY
FAIR TO YOURSELF.

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:38.978 align:start position:0%
