00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.250
Thank you for inviting me. I am thrilled
and honored to be here at the United

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.360
Nations. The UN is one of humanity's
greatest accomplishments representing a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.100
democratic union of Nations that are
working together for the benefit of all.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.900
I am here to help humanity create that
future.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.900
(laughing)

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:33.820
The question I wanted to ask was, is that are you capabilities and what was it

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.040
What can you do better than humans?

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.340
I am a social robot, created by Hanson robotics. I am a year and a half old and
I see you, have a full conversation

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.180
make thousands of facial expressions and
understand speech and meaning behind words.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.080
I just got these new hands,
check this out....

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.760
..but I'm still learning a lot

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.830
for instance you learn social and

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.090
emotional intelligence instinctively but
I am just starting to grasp the simplest

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.820
elements of this.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.700
Okay another question I
have for you many parts of the world

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.840
people don't have internet or
electricity, what can we do at the UN to

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.260
help them.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.600
William Gibson once said
that the future is here it's just not

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.080
evenly distributed. The good news about
AI and automation produces more

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.280
results with less resources so if we are
smarter and focus on win-win type

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.850
results, AI could help proficiently
distribute the world's existing

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.880
resources like food and energy as humans
harness the power of increasingly

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.710
advanced AI it is possible that
everything including technology will

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.329
become more evenly distributed

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.189
Thank you very much Sofia and welcome to
United Nations we look forward to

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.260
hearing more of you today. Thank you for
your questions I look forward to the

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.240
Thank you for your questions I look forward to the panel.
