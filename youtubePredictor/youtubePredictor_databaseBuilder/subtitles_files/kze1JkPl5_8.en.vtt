1
00:00:00.482 --> 00:00:02.664
I'm at the Dead Sea.

2
00:00:02.664 --> 00:00:06.520
Dead Sea is 1,300 feet below sea level,

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.696
it's the lowest point on Earth.

4
00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:12.657
The water is so salty, it is literally impossible to sink

5
00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:15.240
and yet, they have a lifeguard.

6
00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:25.927
Wow!

7
00:00:26.914 --> 00:00:29.192
I can feel my body changing, all the salt.

8
00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:33.359
My penis has been turned into a brined Vlasic pickle.

9
00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:37.004
Be honest, am I too white?

10
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:37.837
Yes, right?

11
00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:38.670 line:15%
Too white.

12
00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:42.067 line:15%
Quick question, are you here with your boyfriend?

13
00:00:42.067 --> 00:00:44.150
Okay, you're with me now.

14
00:00:45.187 --> 00:00:46.728
I took off my wedding ring, they said

15
00:00:46.728 --> 00:00:47.805
you can't wear jewelry in here,

16
00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:51.304
so that means I'm not married while I'm in the dead sea.

17
00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:52.467
Why are you covered in this mud?

18
00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:54.285
You take mud from the Dead Sea

19
00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:56.083
and it has all those minerals and stuff.

20
00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:57.523
So you put it all over your body?

21
00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:58.606
Yeah, yeah.

22
00:01:00.883 --> 00:01:03.622
Is this attractive, do I look attractive now?

23
00:01:03.622 --> 00:01:05.539 line:15%
Attractive Israeli man.

24
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.905
I know, so you think I'm more attractive

25
00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:15.822
covered in mud than as God made me.

26
00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:18.526
I'm going to go that way and I'm going to cry.

27
00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:21.334
Too late for sorry!

28
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.923
May I help you?

29
00:01:24.923 --> 00:01:27.923
Yes, can I get a glass of red wine

30
00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.022
and 600 glasses of water?
