00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.110
So much to talk about.
I know.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:02.943
You look lovely.
Thank you.

00:00:02.943 --> 00:00:04.509
[Conan] You look absolutely stunning.

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:05.342
Thanks.

00:00:05.342 --> 00:00:06.247
[Conan] And yeah, thank you so the suit.

00:00:06.247 --> 00:00:07.080
You look great too.
Well, thank you.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.150
I love the tie, the pink
is very fashionable.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.983
Is it really?

00:00:10.983 --> 00:00:11.900
Yeah, you know, that hot pink.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.248
I thought someone was having
that joke on my expense.

00:00:13.248 --> 00:00:14.081
(both laughing)

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.218
Put this on.

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:16.090
(audience laughs)

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.310
No, I really like it,
it's all coming together.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.480
And I wanna congratulate you

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.760
'cause since the last time
you were here, you had a baby.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.593
Yeah.
That's so exciting.

00:00:23.593 --> 00:00:24.426
Congratulations.

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:25.750
Yeah, so did you.
I did as well, yeah.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.310
And strangely, I actually
brought a picture for you 'cause

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.700
there was a moment there where I thought

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.286
maybe you and I had a
weird drunken night out.

00:00:34.286 --> 00:00:35.287
(audience laughs)

00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:36.120
(Kate Hudson laughs)

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.370
Is it?
That I didn't know about.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.200
Did the baby go through a Conan phase?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.220
Well, the baby's got
red hair, and then he,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.180
yes he went through a big Conan phase.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.620
About, how old was the
baby when this happened?

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.910
About six and a half months
when I started going,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.765
Oh, wait, he looks kinda like Conan.

00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:53.598
(both laughs)

00:00:53.598 --> 00:00:56.258
(audience laughs)

00:00:56.258 --> 00:00:59.258
(audience clapping)

00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:08.502
That baby looks so much
more like me than my baby.

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:11.419
(audience laughs)

00:01:12.902 --> 00:01:13.735
Remember that time you and I

00:01:13.735 --> 00:01:15.495
were in the poetry section
at Barnes and Noble.

00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:16.328
Oh.

00:01:16.328 --> 00:01:17.352
And then it got a little crazy.

00:01:17.352 --> 00:01:19.680
I just thought that was so funny.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.350
That's crazy, the hair and everything.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.470
And I was going to send it to you

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.125
with a little note, but I
spaced and I didn't do that.

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:26.488
My wife would have freaked out.

00:01:26.488 --> 00:01:27.579
(audience laughs)

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.558
What have you been doing?

00:01:29.558 --> 00:01:32.109
Now, how are you liking being a mom?

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.989
Oh I love it.

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:33.822
Yeah.

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:34.655
It's so great.

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:35.488
Yeah.

00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:36.366
It's been so much fun.

00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:37.199
And isn't yours around the same age?

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:38.032
Same age. Yeah.

00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:38.960
About 21 months.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.406
Yeah. So now it's just so much fun.

00:01:41.406 --> 00:01:42.239
Right.

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:43.072
I mean, he's talking

00:01:43.072 --> 00:01:46.350
and running and he's really communicating.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.040
It's just, it just gets better and better.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.508
I love also all the things
that you start doing

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:50.900
that you never really
pictured yourself doing.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.084
Like reading them
stories, singing lullabies

00:01:54.084 --> 00:01:55.149
Oh, yeah.

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.760
and you guys do sing them,
sing the baby lullaby.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.620
Oh well, yeah.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.417
I mean, our lullabies are a little,

00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:02.673
they're not normal lullabies.

00:02:02.673 --> 00:02:04.023
[Conan] What do you mean?

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:06.326
Well, he's from the South.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.564
[Conan] Not like go to sleep, go to sleep.

00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:11.057
No, no, it's like, Chris is from Georgia.

00:02:11.057 --> 00:02:11.890
[Conan] Right.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:12.723
He's from Atlanta.

00:02:12.723 --> 00:02:14.460
So it's, you know, he
grew up on country music.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.817
So it's more like George Jones songs,

00:02:16.817 --> 00:02:18.460
[Conan] You're seeing this sort

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.060
of like sad country western tunes

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.920
Yeah. I mean, it happens.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.960
They have a great lullaby,
like tone to them.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.793
[Conan] Sure. Yeah, yeah.

00:02:26.793 --> 00:02:30.209
They're just usually about
like, losing love and

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.560
(Conan laughs)

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.240
It's a nice thing for the baby to hear.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.590
Yeah, and drinking.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.620
Right, right.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.513
And some, yeah.

00:02:36.513 --> 00:02:38.640
Yeah, the old murder ballads.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.473
Right, right, right.

00:02:39.473 --> 00:02:40.699
Before they go to bed.

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:41.532
Nice for the child to hear

00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:42.365
just before they go to sleep.

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:44.897
And then the man shot me and now I'm dead.

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:45.730
Night, night.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.563
Click

00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:47.396
(Kate Hudson laughs)

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:48.229
(audience laughs)

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:49.952
I sing a lot of AC/DC to my child.

00:02:49.952 --> 00:02:50.785
Nice.

00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:52.960
She was a fast machine
she kept her motor clean.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.040
(audience laughs)

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.410
She was the best damn
woman that I ever seen.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.354
The baby's all wired.

00:02:57.354 --> 00:02:58.670
(audience laughs)

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.556
Baby's frightened out of her mind.

00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:02.033
Oh my goodness.
