00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.279
When Steve Jobs resigned as Apple’s CEO
in August 2011, he handpicked Tim Cook as

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:07.500
his successor.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.120
Cook had been with the company since 1998,
and earned the reputation of being an operations

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.140
mastermind.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.720
Dramatically Apple’s reducing on-hand inventory
and delivering products to customers faster

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.609
using a technique called just-in-time manufacturing.

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.539
But his greatest work has been performed over
the past decade as CEO.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.240
When Apple’s popularity and growth exploded
in a way almost no one expected.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.940
This has led many people to wonder about the
man behind the machine: Tim Cook.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.990
And what he does on a daily basis to stay
at the top of his game.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.180
So in this video, we’re going to take a
peak behind Apple’s curtain, and find out

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.550
what a day in the life of Tim Cook is really
like.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.260
This is Greg with Apple Explained, and this
was the last place topic of the previous voting

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.700
poll, which means I shouldn’t even be making
this video.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.270
But I already started working on the script,
so I’m just putting this out as a short

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.330
bonus video for you guys.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.030
Alright now let’s start with Cook’s morning
routine.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.219
He wakes up at 3:45am.

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:14.130
And spends about an hour going through some
of the 700-800 emails he receives each day.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.500
In an interview with Axios, he explained why.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.429
Saying, “I like to… go through user comments
and things like that, and sort of focus on

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.799
the external people that are so important
to us.”

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.079
For breakfast, Cook typically enjoys two scrambled
egg whites, turkey bacon, and sugar-free cereal

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.210
with unsweetened almond milk.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.020
Then, around 5am, he goes to an undisclosed
gym that’s located outside Apple’s headquarters,

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.990
for maximum privacy, and works out for an
hour.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.670
In fact, Cook is a self-described “fitness
nut.”

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.090
Claiming his regular exercise routine helps
keep stress at bay, which is probably important

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.710
for someone in charge of running the most
valuable company in the world.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.939
Next, Cook visits a local Starbucks to read
through more emails before heading to Apple

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:02.979
Park.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.390
Once he arrives at the office, his day is
typically filled with meetings.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.040
And despite his laid back demeanor, Cook is
known to have little patience for unprepared

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.040
staffers.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.349
In fact, workers who are scheduled to meet
with Cook are first screened by their managers,

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.319
to make sure they’re ready to answer all
of his questions.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.909
And Cook is known to ask quite a few.

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:30.829
Steve Doil, who used to work on Cook’s operations
team, said, “He’ll ask you ten questions.

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.890
If you answer them right, he’ll ask you
ten more.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.480
If you do this for a year, he’ll start asking
you nine questions.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.720
Get one wrong, and he’ll ask you 20 and
then 30.”

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.959
One staffer who wasn’t fully prepared was
quickly dismissed by Cook.

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.939
Who simply said, “next.”

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.180
As he flipped the page of his meeting agenda.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.599
But I think the story that best illustrates
Cook’s expectation of excellence, is during

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.830
a meeting about Apple’s poor performance
in China.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.819
Cook said, “This is really bad, someone
should be in China driving this.”

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.560
Thirty minutes into the meeting, he looked
at Sabih Khan, an operations executive, and

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.319
asked, with no emotion, “Why are you still
here?”

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.299
Khan immediately stood up, drove to San Francisco
International Airport, and, without any luggage,

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.410
booked a one-way ticket to China.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.069
For lunch, Cook is known to stop by the company
cafeteria and sit with random employees.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.620
This allows him to hear from people in the
company who might offer a unique perspective

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.790
outside the bubble of Apple’s executive
team.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.200
Cook is also known to be the last person to
leave the office.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.599
Arriving home just in time to be in bed by
8:45.

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.540
That means he works about 12 hours a day while
sleeping for 7.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.459
So while Tim Cook has been criticized for
being a much different CEO than Steve Jobs,

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.099
the two have a surprising amount of characteristics
in common.

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.500
Like working long hours, focusing on their
health, holding their employees to the highest

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.620
standard, and always maintaining a balanced
perspective on Apple by staying in touch with

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.870
their everyday customers.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.890
So that is the day in the life of Tim Cook,
