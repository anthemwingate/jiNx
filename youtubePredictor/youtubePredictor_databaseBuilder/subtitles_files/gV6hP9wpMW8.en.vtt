&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO LET'S TALK

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:42.375 align:start position:0%
ABOUT THE TESLA.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.343 align:start position:0%

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.116 size:88% position:44%
YOU GOT A NEW THING THAT YOU

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.918
THINK IS-- PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.686 align:start position:0%
UPON FOR THEIR TESLA.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.388 size:84% position:42%
JIM, CAN WE SHOW FOOTAGE OF

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:55.588 align:start position:0%
THIS?

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:57.524
I THINK IT'S CALLED-- THIS THING

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:00.026 align:start position:0%
IS THE POWER ARM.

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:04.597 align:start position:0%
THAT IS AN EXTREMELY--

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.433 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; IT'S A SNAKE CHARGER.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:07.600 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S A SNAKE

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.735
CHARGER THAT AUTOMATICALLY PLUGS

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.770
INTO YOUR CAR WHEN YOU GET HOME.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.906
&gt;&gt; THIS LOOKS A LITTLE WRONG.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:13.239 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER ).

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:13.840
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT REALLY LOOKS

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.176
LIKE THE THING THAT JACKS INTO

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:20.280
THE BACK OF NEO'S HEAD IN "THE

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.513 align:start position:0%
MATRIX."

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:21.481 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.348 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS THAT THING

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:24.317
GOING TO ATTACK ME IN MY SLEEP?

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:26.352
&gt;&gt; FOR THE PROTOTYPE, AT LEAST,

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.354
I WOULD RECOMMEND NOT DROPPING

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.956
ANYTHING WHEN YOU'RE NEAR IT.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:35.128 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:36.663 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.565
NOW ANOTHER THING THAT YOU ARE

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:41.167
TALKING ABOUT IS YOU SINCERELY

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.670
THINK THAT WE SHOULD GO TO MARS,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.806
THAT MEN AND WOMEN SHOULD GO TO

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:47.273 align:start position:0%
MARS.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:47.574 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:48.608
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHY DO WE WANT TO

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:51.544 align:start position:0%
GO TO MARS?

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:52.312 align:start position:0%
IT'S UNINHABITABLE.

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:55.215
VE TOBE IN DOMES AND EVERYTHING.

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:55.982 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; INITIALLY.

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:56.950 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: INITIALLY?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.183 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.318 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: REALLY?

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:00.019
HOW LONG BEFORE WE CAN TURN MARS

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:02.155
INTO SOMEPLACE WE CAN LIVE IT IS

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:04.657 size:81% position:41%
A FIXER-UPPER OF A PLANET.

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.259
SO AT FIRST YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.461
TO LIVE IN TRANSPARENT DOMES,

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.429 align:start position:0%
BUT EVENTUALLY --

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.066
&gt;&gt; YES, WE'RE GOING TO BE HUFG

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:13.633 align:start position:0%
EACH OTHER.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.768 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; BUT EVENTUALLY YOU CAN

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.437 align:start position:0%
TRANSFORM MARS INTO AN

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:18.004 align:start position:0%
AIRCRAFT-LIKE PLANET.

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:19.472 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HOW WOULD YOU DO

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
THAT?

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YOU WARM IT UP.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.674 align:start position:0%
JUST WARM IT UP.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.143 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WITH A BLANKET

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.145
OR-- HOW WOULD YOU WARM MARS UP?

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.614
IT'S A LONG WAY AWAY FROM THE

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
SUN.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.449
&gt;&gt; THERE'S A FAST WAY AND A SLOW

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.616 align:start position:0%
WAY.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.818
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY, GIVE ME THE

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:32.085 align:start position:0%
FAST WAY.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.854 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; THE FAST WAY IS DROP THE

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:37.690 size:84% position:42%
NUCLEAR WEAPONS OVER POLES.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.492 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU'RE A SUPER

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:39.759 align:start position:0%
VILLAIN!

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.661 size:84% position:42%
THAT'S WHAT A SUPER VILLAIN

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:41.861 align:start position:0%
DOES.

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:42.862 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.
