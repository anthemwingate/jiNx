00:00:17.263 --> 00:00:19.080
Dialogue gives a story color,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.513
makes it exciting and moves it forward.

00:00:21.513 --> 00:00:26.380
Romeo: O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.603
Juliet: What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

00:00:30.603 --> 00:00:36.930
Romeo: The exchange of thy love's faithful vows for mine.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.997
Without dialogue: (cricket sounds)

00:00:40.997 --> 00:00:44.580
So what goes into writing effective dialogue?

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.130
Well, there are social skills:

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.913
making friends, solving conflicts, being pleasant and polite.

00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:54.414
We won't be using any of those today.

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:59.132
Instead, we'll be working on -- let's call them "anti-social skills."

00:00:59.132 --> 00:01:03.031
If you're a writer, you may already have a few of these.

00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:05.380
The first is eavesdropping.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.282
If you're riding a bus and hear an interesting conversation, you could write it all down.

00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:14.480
Of course, when you write fiction, you're not describing real people,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.263
you're making up characters.

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:19.980
But sometimes the words you overhear can give you ideas.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.764
"I did not," says one person.

00:01:22.764 --> 00:01:25.481
"I saw you," the other replies.

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:28.314
Who might be saying those words?

00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:33.764
Maybe it's two kids in a class, and the boy thinks the girl pushed him.

00:01:33.764 --> 00:01:36.963
Maybe it's a couple, but one of them is a vampire,

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:41.213
and the woman vampire saw the man flirting with a zombie.

00:01:41.213 --> 00:01:43.249
Or maybe not.

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.746
Maybe the characters are a teenager and his mother,

00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:50.996
and they're supposed to be vegetarians, but the mother saw him eating a burger.

00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:53.664
So let's say you've decided on some characters.

00:01:53.664 --> 00:01:55.984
This is anti-social skill number two:

00:01:55.984 --> 00:01:58.348
start pretending they're real.

00:01:58.348 --> 00:02:01.847
What are they like? Where are they from? What music do they listen to?

00:02:01.847 --> 00:02:03.514
Spend some time with them.

00:02:03.514 --> 00:02:06.613
If you're on a bus, think about what they might be doing if they were there too.

00:02:06.613 --> 00:02:08.697
Would they talk on the phone, listen to music,

00:02:08.697 --> 00:02:10.830
draw pictures, sleep?

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.982
What we say depends on who we are.

00:02:13.982 --> 00:02:16.803
An older person might speak differently than a younger person.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:20.663
Someone from the south might speak differently than someone from the north.

00:02:20.663 --> 00:02:25.046
Once you know your characters, you can figure out how they talk.

00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:28.865
At this stage, it's helpful to use anti-social skill number three:

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:29.980
muttering to yourself.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.312
When you speak your character's words, you can hear whether they sound natural,

00:02:33.312 --> 00:02:35.480
and fix them if necessary.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.131
Remember, most people are usually pretty informal when they speak.

00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:41.832
They use simple language and contractions.

00:02:41.832 --> 00:02:48.032
So, "Do not attempt to lie to me" sounds more natural as "Don't try to lie to me."

00:02:48.032 --> 00:02:50.230
Also keep it short.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.231
People tend to speak in short bursts,

00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:54.364
not lengthy speeches.

00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:56.213
And let the dialogue do the work.

00:02:56.213 --> 00:03:00.130
Ask yourself: do I really need that adverb?

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.913
For instance, "'Your money or your life,' she said threateningly."

00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:08.831
Here, "threateningly" is redundant, so you can get rid of it.

00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:13.347
But if the words and the actions don't match, an adverb can be helpful.

00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:17.380
"'Your money or your life,' she said lovingly."

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.680
So, to recap:

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.498
First, eavesdrop. Next, pretend imaginary people are real.

00:03:23.498 --> 00:03:27.980
Finally, mutter to yourself, and write it all down.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.698
You already have everything you need.

00:03:30.698 --> 00:03:34.813
This is fictional dialogue, or "How to Hear Voices in Your Head."
