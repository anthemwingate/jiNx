00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:02.767
-Hi.

00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:04.267
Hi, this is Jimmy Fallon.

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:08.167
I'm coming to you from my home.

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:10.267
But actually,
this is a pod school.

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:13.801
It's called The Barn School --
it's a newer curriculum school

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:17.000
and they're very good students,
and they're very, very polite,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.667
and thank you, Winnie,
I appreciate that.

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:25.734
And before it was a school, we
did a show from here a year ago,

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:29.267
and before it was a show,
it was my home.

00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:33.634
And so, welcome to our show,
and obviously,

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:35.868
if we did the show from here,
I couldn't do the show

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:38.501
from here, so our friends at
Airstream gave me

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:40.767
a quieter studio
to do the show from.

00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:43.400
Let me show you
what I'm talking about. Come.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.300
This is the biggest Airstream
they make,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.934
and our genius set designers
turned it into kind of

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:51.033
a portable studio.
Let me show you.

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:55.367
Welcome to our home
away from home --

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:56.767
our studio away from home.

00:00:56.767 --> 00:00:59.901
How cool is this?
What a great job everyone did

00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:02.901
with lighting and sound --
every little detail.

00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:04.300
Look at the technology!

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.734
These are 4K cameras being
controlled from New York --

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.801
Alex Coletti --
Alex, can you hear me?

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:12.767
-Loud and clear, Jimmy.
-There you go.

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:15.400
I mean, we have -- I can do
my monologue from this desk

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.200
right here.
I'll be doing interviews

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.868
from over here,

00:01:18.868 --> 00:01:21.400
and talking to Matthew and Megan
through Zoom,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.601
and we have a turntable because
why not.

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:27.534
Let's listen to what we have
here.

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:28.467
It's our theme song.

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:29.267

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.868

00:01:47.868 --> 00:01:50.701

-That sounded great.

We have a great show for you
tonight, guys.

00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:55.801
He is hosting a benefit concert
called We Are Texas

00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:58.868
this Sunday on his new Youtube
channel -- Matthew McConaughey

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:01.067
is here.
Plus, she's a gold medalist

00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:05.000
and two-time World Cup champion,
Megan Rapinoe is with us.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.467
Then we got music from
Morris Day,

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:08.801
featuring Trinidad James.
Morris Day!

00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:10.534
Come on.

00:02:10.534 --> 00:02:12.501
Also, as part of tonight's
special show,

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:14.868
we've teamed up with
our neighbors at State Farm

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.334
to help raise money for
Feeding America,

00:02:17.334 --> 00:02:19.734
a great organization.
Great, great, great organization

00:02:19.734 --> 00:02:21.701
devoted to feeding the hungry.

00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:25.868
State Farm has already provided
$1.3 million of funding

00:02:25.868 --> 00:02:27.634
to Feeding America
this past year,

00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:31.167
and tonight, they're going to
match up to $100,000

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:34.300
in donations until midnight
Eastern Standard Time tomorrow.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.234
You can donate by going to
feedingamerica.org/tonightshow.

00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:41.400
It'll help feed a lot of people.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.067
Every little bit
makes a difference.

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:46.968
Look at these.
