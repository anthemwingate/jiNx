00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.680
You see yourself working for somebody
else? I never have. Can you see it? I'm

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.019
used to to having a company where the
ideas that I have or something that I

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.080
can easily pursue. So I think it'd be a
tough transition.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.720
If you had stayed at Harvard a few more years, would this a
computer revolution who passed you by?

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.620
Perhaps. Things move very quickly in the
industry and it was really the urgency

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.000
to get out there and be the first one to
put a basic on the microcomputer that

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.710
caused me to drop out. You're called a
genius and I will well no I don't think

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.559
that embarrassed you at all. (laughs) They call you a genius.

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.430
Part of you genius is that you are a
computer whiz and the other is that you

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.550
did have the business acumen to turn it
into a working company. Are you a business genius too?

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.199
Well, I wouldn't say genius. I enjoy

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.400
working with the people, talking about
what we're gonna get done, getting real

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.080
excited, making sure that the structure
is there, that the ideas get get measured

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.200
properly and I'm really leading the
company. That's exciting.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.900
At the age of 28, in a field of work
where burnout is commonly, are you gonna burn

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.690
out before you're 30?No. How do you know?
Well, the work we're doing is it's not

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.160
like, you know, we're doing the same thing
all day long. We go into our offices and

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.810
think up new programs, we get together in
meetings, we go out and see end users, we

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.410
talk to customers.There's so much
variety and there's always new things

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.300
going on. And I don't think they'll ever
come a time with that that would be boring.
