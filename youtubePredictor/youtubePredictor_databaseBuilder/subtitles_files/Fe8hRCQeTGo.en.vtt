00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.370
Hey, Conan O'Brien here.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.890
I hope, like me, you're staying calm,

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.460
you're staying safe, and
you're staying at home

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.840
avoiding crowds.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.890
One thing people are worried about

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.440
is where can they get hand sanitizer?

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.300
That's right, some guy came
along, went to the store,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.570
and he bought up all the hand sanitizer.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.160
And he has much more than he needs

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.280
and he's just sitting on it.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.810
And he wants like 10,000 dollars a squirt.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.848
The guy's like, "What are
you gonna do about it?

00:00:28.848 --> 00:00:30.940
"What are you gonna do about it?"

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.290
That's just a character I came up with,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.617
but I bet that's exactly
what the guy sounds like.

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:35.896
"What are you gonna do?"

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:37.376
"What are you gonna do about it?"

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:41.460
"Are you gonna buy my
sanitizer?" (chortling)

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.200
It's just a guy I came up with.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.010
Yeah, I don't have a name for him yet,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.300
but I'm working on it.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.330
The point is this: don't worry
about buying hand sanitizer.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.420
You can make it at home, and
I'll show you how right now.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.800
Start off with a bottle of Tito's vodka.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.030
So you take your Tito's, okay?

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.483
Pour out a little bit to make room.

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:16.280
(yelling) Next ingredient: Listerine.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.420
Just about that much should do.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.070
You want this stuff to spread
on real nice and smooth.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.410
That's where Kiehl's hand lotion comes in.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.000
And just make sure you get
a lotta Kiehl's in there.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.610
Next, garlic.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.420
Garlic kills everything, just
ask a vampire. (chuckling)

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.390
That's joke's free. (sings gibberish)

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.810
Get a Windex bottle that
you've got around the house.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.530
Take the sklootcher,
which is what I call it.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.950
Screw that on, and bingo, bango, bongo,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.920
you are ready to go.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.032
Look at that, look at that.

00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:56.601
Look at that, look at that!

00:01:56.601 --> 00:01:58.670
Hold on a second; look at that!

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.733
Here we go, look!

00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:02.130
It's got Kiehl's in it!

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.533
The Kiehl's broke it!

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.570
Don't put as much Kiehl's in as I did.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.603
Still, it works just fine.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.053
My hands are drunk.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.203
Hope that helped; be well.
