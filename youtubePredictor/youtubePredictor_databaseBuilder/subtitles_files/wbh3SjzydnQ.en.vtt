00:00:06.677 --> 00:00:11.425
There's a factory inside you 
that weighs about 1.4 kilograms

00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:14.340
and runs for 24 hours a day.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.022
This is your liver,
the heaviest organ in your body,

00:00:18.022 --> 00:00:20.003
and one of the most crucial.

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:23.690
This industrious structure 
simultaneously acts as a storehouse,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.492
a manufacturing hub,

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.567
and a processing plant.

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:31.080
And each of these functions involve 
so many important subtasks

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.429
that without the liver, 
our bodies would simply stop working.

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:38.876
One of the liver's main functions 
is to filter the body's blood,

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:42.415
which it receives in regular shipments 
from two sources:

00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:45.542
the hepatic artery 
delivers blood from the heart,

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:49.165
while the hepatic portal vein 
brings it from the intestine.

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:51.872
This double delivery 
fills the liver with nutrients,

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:54.563
that it then sorts, processes and stores

00:00:54.563 --> 00:00:58.011
with the help of thousands 
of tiny internal processing plants,

00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:00.033
known as lobules.

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:03.711
Both blood flows also deliver the oxygen 
that the liver needs to function.

00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:05.855
The blood that is received 
from the intestine

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:08.076
contains carbohydrates, fats,

00:01:08.076 --> 00:01:11.120
and vitamins and other nutrients 
dissolved in it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.084
from the food you've consumed.

00:01:13.084 --> 00:01:15.189
These must be processed in different ways.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:16.635
In the case of carbohydrates,

00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:19.694
the liver breaks them down 
and converts them into sugars

00:01:19.694 --> 00:01:24.134
for the body to use as energy 
when the filtered blood is sent back out.

00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:26.684
Sometimes the body 
has leftovers of nutrients

00:01:26.684 --> 00:01:28.768
that it doesn't immediately require.

00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:31.426
When that happens, 
the liver holds some back,

00:01:31.426 --> 00:01:33.867
and stacks them in its storage facility.

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:35.920
This facility works like a pantry

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.077
for future cases when the body 
might be in need of nutrients.

00:01:39.077 --> 00:01:43.102
But the blood flowing into the liver
isn't always full of good things.

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:47.607
It also contains toxins
and byproducts that the body can't use.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:50.113
And the liver monitors these strictly.

00:01:50.113 --> 00:01:52.409
When it spots
a useless or toxic substance,

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.701
it either converts it into a product 
that can't hurt the body

00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:58.128
or isolates it and whisks it away,

00:01:58.128 --> 00:02:01.563
channeling it through 
the kidneys and intestine to be excreted.

00:02:01.563 --> 00:02:04.044
Of course, we wouldn't consider 
the liver a factory

00:02:04.044 --> 00:02:06.707
if it didn't also manufacture things.

00:02:06.707 --> 00:02:09.963
This organ makes everything 
from various blood plasma proteins

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.982
that transport fatty acids 
and help form blood clots,

00:02:12.982 --> 00:02:16.055
to the cholesterol 
that helps the body create hormones.

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:19.850
It also makes vitamin D
and substances that help digestion.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.724
But one of its most vital products 
is bile.

00:02:22.724 --> 00:02:24.965
Like an eco-friendly treatment plant,

00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:27.483
the liver uses cells called hepatocytes

00:02:27.483 --> 00:02:31.771
to convert toxic waste products 
into this bitter greenish liquid.

00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:36.022
As it's produced, bile is funneled 
into a small container below the liver,

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.650
called the gallbladder,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.054
before being trickled into the intestine

00:02:40.054 --> 00:02:45.194
to help break down fats, destroy microbes,
and neutralize extra stomach acid.

00:02:45.194 --> 00:02:48.940
Bile also helps carry other toxins 
and byproducts from the liver

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.292
out of the body.

00:02:50.292 --> 00:02:51.374
So as you can see,

00:02:51.374 --> 00:02:53.909
the liver is an extremely efficient 
industrial site,

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.549
performing multiple tasks 
that support each other.

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.962
But such a complex system 
needs to be kept running smoothly

00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:01.192
by keeping it healthy

00:03:01.192 --> 00:03:04.380
and not overloading it 
with more toxins than it can handle.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.971
This is one factory 
we simply can't afford to shut down.
