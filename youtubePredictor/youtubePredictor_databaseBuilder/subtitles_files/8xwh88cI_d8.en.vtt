00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.272
If you read enough, there's a similarity 
between things that make it easy,

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:09.109
because this thing is like this other thing.

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:18.385
If you have a broad framework,
then you have a place to put everything.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:23.123
If you want to learn science, reading 
the history of scientists and the story of scientists

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:29.629
about when they were confused and what tools or insights allowed them to make the progress they make.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:31.931
So you have the timeline, or you have the map,

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:36.002
or you have the branches of science 
and what's known and what's not known.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:46.479
So, incremental knowledge is so much easier 
to maintain in a rich way

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:52.085
than, you know, the first time somebody
is telling you about Rome.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.788
Why am I reading about Rome,
I'm reading about Queen Victoria.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:57.424
At first it is very daunting.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:03.696
But then as you get the kind of scope,
then all these pieces fit in.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:11.137
So it's fun to say, okay, this is where this belongs and 
does this contradict something I knew before?

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:13.807
And I better look that up, I better figure it out.

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:17.911
You know, it really bothers you when 
you read things, and there's some inconsistency.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:23.683
If you take a chessboard and randomly place the pieces
and ask a chess person to memorize it,

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:31.291
they can't do it, because everything about chess positions is about the logic of how things developed.

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:38.031
So if you show them a position that's illogical 
or incorrect, you would never get to,

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:43.369
their encoding system isn't set up to absorb that.
